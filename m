[ Upstream commit f097d246677b03db814c5862f368cea341b76a00 ]

mcp2221_raw_event() copies device-supplied data into mcp->rxbuf at
offset rxbuf_idx without checking that the copy fits within the
destination buffer. A device responding with up to 60 bytes to a
small I2C/SMBus read can overflow the buffer.

Add a rxbuf_size field to struct mcp2221, set it alongside rxbuf in
mcp_i2c_smbus_read(), and check rxbuf_idx + data[3] <= rxbuf_size
before the memcpy.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## Phase 1: Commit Message Forensics
Step 1.1 Record: subsystem `HID: mcp2221`; action verb `fix`; claimed
intent: prevent an out-of-bounds write in `mcp2221_raw_event()` when
copying device-supplied I2C read data into `mcp->rxbuf`.

Step 1.2 Record: tags found in upstream commit
`f097d246677b03db814c5862f368cea341b76a00`: `Reported-by: Benoît Sevens
<bsevens@google.com>`, `Signed-off-by: Florian Pradines
<florian.pradines@gmail.com>`, `Signed-off-by: Jiri Kosina
<jkosina@suse.com>`. No `Fixes:`, no `Cc: stable`, no `Link:` in the
commit message.

Step 1.3 Record: bug description is explicit: `mcp2221_raw_event()`
copies `data[3]` bytes into `mcp->rxbuf + rxbuf_idx` without checking
the destination buffer size. Failure mode is kernel memory corruption
via OOB write when a device returns up to 60 bytes for a smaller
requested read.

Step 1.4 Record: not hidden; this is a direct memory-safety fix.

## Phase 2: Diff Analysis
Step 2.1 Record: one file changed, `drivers/hid/hid-mcp2221.c`, 7
insertions. Modified areas: `struct mcp2221`, `mcp_i2c_smbus_read()`,
`mcp2221_raw_event()`. Scope: single-file surgical fix.

Step 2.2 Record: before, the driver tracked `rxbuf` and `rxbuf_idx` but
not the destination size. After, it stores `rxbuf_size` when setting
`rxbuf`, and rejects `rxbuf_idx + data[3] > rxbuf_size` before
`memcpy()`.

Step 2.3 Record: bug category is memory safety, specifically OOB write
from device-controlled length and cumulative receive offset. The earlier
`data[3] > 60` check only capped a single MCP2221 report, not the
destination buffer size.

Step 2.4 Record: fix is minimal and locally correct for the upstream
parent, but direct stable backports need care because older stable
branches still have two manual `mcp_smbus_xfer()` paths that set
`mcp->rxbuf` directly.

## Phase 3: Git History
Step 3.1 Record: `git blame` showed `rxbuf`, `rxbuf_idx`,
`mcp_i2c_smbus_read()`, and the `memcpy()` path originated in
`67a95c21463d0`, first contained in `v5.7-rc1`. The partial-read
handling came from `2682468671aa0`, first contained in `v6.8-rc1`. The
prior per-report `data[3] > 60` guard came from `b56cc41a3ae73`, first
contained in `v6.17-rc4` and backported to stable equivalents.

Step 3.2 Record: no `Fixes:` tag, so no tagged introducing commit to
follow.

Step 3.3 Record: recent related commits include `b56cc41a3ae73` for the
60-byte report cap, `e31b556c0ba21` for read-error cancellation, and
`ab05515757fcb` for using `mcp_i2c_smbus_read()` for block reads.
`ab05515757fcb` is an important context dependency for the exact
upstream diff.

Step 3.4 Record: author Florian Pradines had no other local commits
found in `drivers/hid`; Jiri Kosina, the HID maintainer,
committed/applied the patch.

Step 3.5 Record: upstream parent contains `ab05515757fcb`; stable
branches checked from `5.10.y` through `7.0.y` do not. A stable backport
should either adapt the patch to set `rxbuf_size` in the two remaining
manual `mcp_smbus_xfer()` paths or include an appropriate
prerequisite/backport.

## Phase 4: Mailing List / External Research
Step 4.1 Record: `b4 dig -c f097d246677b03db814c5862f368cea341b76a00`
found the lore thread: `https://patch.msgid.link/20260509094517.2691246-
1-florian.pradines@gmail.com`. `b4 dig -a` showed only v1.

Step 4.2 Record: `b4 dig -w` showed recipients included Florian
Pradines, Rishi Gupta, Jiri Kosina, Benjamin Tissoires, `linux-i2c`, and
`linux-input`.

Step 4.3 Record: reporter Benoît Sevens previously submitted a similar
heap-buffer-overflow patch. Jiri replied that Benoît’s patch was mangled
and that Florian’s patch would be taken with Benoît added as `Reported-
by`. Benoît then noted the missing `mcp_smbus_xfer()` assignments, which
is relevant for older stable bases.

Step 4.4 Record: not part of a multi-patch series. Related patches exist
for report-size validation, but Jiri questioned the “MCP2221 always
sends 64-byte reports” assumption in that separate thread.

Step 4.5 Record: direct lore/stable WebFetch was blocked by Anubis, but
web search found related stable discussion for prior mcp2221 fixes, not
an exact stable request for `f097d246677b`.

## Phase 5: Semantic Analysis
Step 5.1 Record: changed function is `mcp_i2c_smbus_read()`; changed
callback is `mcp2221_raw_event()`.

Step 5.2 Record: callers of `mcp_i2c_smbus_read()` are `mcp_i2c_xfer()`
and `mcp_smbus_xfer()`, wired into `mcp_i2c_algo`. `mcp2221_raw_event()`
is called from HID core before normal raw report processing, via
`hid_input_report()` / `__hid_input_report()`.

Step 5.3 Record: affected callees include `mcp_send_data_req_status()`,
`mcp_send_report()`, `wait_for_completion_timeout()`, and the vulnerable
`memcpy()`.

Step 5.4 Record: reachability is real: USB HID interrupt input reaches
`mcp2221_raw_event()`, and I2C/SMBus transfers reach
`mcp_i2c_smbus_read()` through the registered I2C adapter.
Triggerability by an unprivileged local user was not verified; trigger
by a malicious or buggy MCP2221-side device response is verified by the
code path.

Step 5.5 Record: similar pattern found in stable branches: two manual
`mcp_smbus_xfer()` receive-buffer assignments remain in stable branches
and must be handled in backports.

## Phase 6: Stable Tree Analysis
Step 6.1 Record: the driver was introduced in `v5.7-rc1`; local stable
refs `5.10.y`, `5.15.y`, `6.1.y`, `6.6.y`, `6.12.y`, `6.18.y`, `6.19.y`,
and `7.0.y` contain the vulnerable `rxbuf`/`memcpy()` pattern. `5.4.y`
does not contain the driver.

Step 6.2 Record: `git apply --check` against current
`stable/linux-7.0.y` succeeds syntactically, but semantic backport work
is needed because stable lacks `ab05515757fcb`.

Step 6.3 Record: prior stable branches already contain the earlier
60-byte cap fix or its backported equivalent, but that does not fix
cumulative overflow into smaller destination buffers.

## Phase 7: Subsystem Context
Step 7.1 Record: subsystem is HID driver for the Microchip MCP2221 USB-
to-I2C/SMBus bridge. Criticality: driver-specific, but memory corruption
from USB/HID device input is high severity for affected systems.

Step 7.2 Record: file history shows active recent maintenance and
multiple security/correctness fixes in this driver.

## Phase 8: Impact And Risk
Step 8.1 Record: affected population is users of MCP2221 hardware or
systems exposed to such USB HID devices.

Step 8.2 Record: trigger is an I2C/SMBus read where the MCP2221-side
response reports more bytes than the destination buffer can hold.
Physical/malicious-device trigger is verified; unprivileged local
trigger depends on device-node permissions and was not verified.

Step 8.3 Record: failure mode is OOB write into kernel memory, severity
HIGH to CRITICAL due to memory corruption/crash/security risk.

Step 8.4 Record: benefit is high. Risk is low for the upstream parent
and for correctly adapted stable backports. Risk is medium for blind
cherry-picks into older stable branches because `rxbuf_size` would not
be set in all stable receive-buffer paths.

## Phase 9: Final Synthesis
Evidence for backporting: real OOB write, explicit reporter, small
patch, maintainer-applied, affects stable-supported code since `5.10.y`,
fixes a memory-corruption class bug.

Evidence against or concerns: no `Fixes:`/`Cc: stable`; exact upstream
diff assumes `ab05515757fcb`, absent from checked stable branches; blind
cherry-pick is not sufficient for older stable trees.

Stable rules checklist: obviously correct on its upstream base: yes.
Fixes a real user-affecting bug: yes. Important issue: yes, kernel
memory corruption. Small and contained: yes, 7 insertions. No new
feature/API: yes. Applies to stable: syntactically yes on `7.0.y`, but
older stable needs a branch-specific backport adjustment.

Exception category: none; this is a memory-safety fix, not a device
ID/quirk/doc/build exception.

## Verification
- Phase 1: fetched and inspected upstream commit
  `f097d246677b03db814c5862f368cea341b76a00`.
- Phase 2: verified exact diff is 7 insertions in `drivers/hid/hid-
  mcp2221.c`.
- Phase 3: ran `git blame`, `git describe --contains`, and targeted `git
  log` without `--all`; identified `67a95c21463d0`, `2682468671aa0`,
  `b56cc41a3ae73`, and `ab05515757fcb`.
- Phase 4: ran `b4 dig -c`, `b4 dig -a`, `b4 dig -w`, and fetched mboxes
  with `b4 mbox`; verified Jiri’s “Applied, thanks” and Benoît’s earlier
  report/backport-relevant concern.
- Phase 5: used code search and file reads to verify HID and I2C/SMBus
  call paths.
- Phase 6: used `git grep` against stable refs to verify vulnerable
  patterns in `5.10.y` through `7.0.y`, and absence from `5.4.y`.
- Phase 6: verified exact patch syntactically applies to current
  `stable/linux-7.0.y`, but `ab05515757fcb` is not an ancestor of
  checked stable refs.
- Phase 8: severity is based on verified device-controlled `memcpy()`
  into kernel buffer without destination-size check.
- UNVERIFIED: no runtime reproducer was executed; no build test was run;
  unprivileged local triggerability was not verified.

This should be backported, but stable maintainers should not blindly
cherry-pick it into pre-`ab05515757fcb` trees without adding
`rxbuf_size` initialization to every remaining `mcp->rxbuf` assignment.
