I'll keep that mind in the future.

I don't think your depiction is entirely accurate of the situtation=20
though. The reporter had confirmed that if bwctrl is change(s) are=20
reverted, the problem is not observed.

So I set to understand why bwctrl has any impact here at all since it=20
should touch only a different device (and even that in relatively limited=
=20
ways). And that is how I found that if bwctrl is not enabled during reset,=
=20
the problem is also not observed.

I also noted that the patch just works around the problems and there was=20
also informal speculation about the suspected root cause in the patch (the=
=20
only other theory I've a about the root cause relates to extra interrupts=
=20
causing a problem through hp/pme interrupt handlers).

I've problem in understanding how reverting bwctrl change does "solve" to=
=20
this. Bwctrl is not even supposed to touch Nvidia GPU at all AFAIK.

A lots of these suggestions do not make much sense to me given that=20
reverting bwctrl alone does not exhibit the problem. E.g., the reset=20
method should be exactly the same.

I can see there could be some way through either hp or PME interrupt=20
handlers, where an extra interrupt that comes due to bwctrl (LBMIE) being=
=20
enabled triggers one of the such behaviors. But none of the above=20
description theoritizes anything to that direction.

Why would execution of pcie_bwnotif_irq() be a problem, it's not that
complicated?

I'm more worried that having LBMIE enabled causes also the other interrupt=
=20
handlers to execute due to the shared interrupt.

I'm sorry for the delay, I've been sick for a while.
