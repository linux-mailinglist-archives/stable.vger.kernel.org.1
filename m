Early rising my dear,

I assume you and your family are in good health. I am the foreign
operations Manager at one of the leading generation bank here in West
Africa.

This being a wide world in which it can be difficult to make new
acquaintances and because it is virtually impossible to know who is
trustworthy and who can be believed, I have decided to repose
confidence in you after much fasting and prayer.

It is only because of this that I have decided to confide in you and
to share with you this confidential business.

In my bank, there resides an overdue and unclaimed sum of $7m, (Seven
Million Dollars Only) when the account holder suddenly passed on, he
left no beneficiary who would be entitled to the receipt of this fund.
For this reason, I have found it expedient to transfer this fund to a
trustworthy individual with capacity to act as foreign business
partner.

Thus I humbly request your assistance to claim this fund.

Upon the transfer of this fund in your account, you will take 45% as
your share from the total fund, 10% will be shared to Charity
Organizations in both country and 45% will be for me. Please if you
are really sure you can handle this project, contact me immediately.

Below you will see the list of information that I will need from you.

-Your Telephone Number
-Your Residential Address:

Please reply to me if you accept this Business deal I proposed to you
immediately.


Thanks,


Yours Faithful,
Mr. Mr. Abdulah Aziz Bello.
