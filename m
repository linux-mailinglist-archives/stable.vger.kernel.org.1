[ Upstream commit 8ceb70c9f970bfbdceb1e51578850a60b9de2236 ]

On IMX7ULP platforms, certain SD cards (e.g. Kingston Canvas Go! Plus)
cause system hangs and reboots during manual tuning. These cards exhibit
large gaps (~16us) between tuning command response and data transmission.
When cmd CRC errors occur during tuning, the code assumes data errors even
tuning data hasn't been fully received and then reset host data circuit.

Per IMX7ULP reference manual, reset operations (RESET_DATA/ALL) need to
make sure no active data transfers. Previously, resetting while data was
in-flight would clear data circuit, including ADMA/SDMA address, causing
data to be transmitted to incorrect memory address. This patch adds
polling for data transfer completion before executing resets.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Now I have all the information needed for a comprehensive analysis. Let
me compile the final assessment.

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

### Step 1.1: Subject Line
- **Subsystem**: `mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx:` (MMC host controller driver for
  NXP i.MX ESDHC)
- **Action verb**: "wait" (defensive/preventive action)
- **Summary**: Wait for data transfer completion before resetting the
  host data circuit to avoid system hang.

Record: [mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx] [wait/prevent] [Prevent system hang by
ensuring data transfer is complete before reset]

### Step 1.2: Tags
- **Signed-off-by**: Luke Wang <ziniu.wang_1@nxp.com> (author, NXP
  engineer)
- **Reviewed-by**: Bough Chen <haibo.chen@nxp.com> (NXP subsystem
  maintainer for sdhci-esdhc-imx, prolific contributor)
- **Acked-by**: Adrian Hunter <adrian.hunter@intel.com> (senior
  SDHCI/MMC subsystem maintainer)
- **Signed-off-by**: Ulf Hansson <ulf.hansson@linaro.org> (MMC subsystem
  maintainer who merged this)
- No Fixes: tag (expected for autosel candidates)
- No Cc: stable (expected)
- No Link: tag

Record: Reviewed by NXP subsystem expert (haibo.chen), ACK'd by sdhci
co-maintainer (Adrian Hunter), merged by MMC maintainer (Ulf Hansson).
Strong review chain.

### Step 1.3: Body Analysis
- **Bug**: On IMX7ULP platforms, certain SD cards (Kingston Canvas Go!
  Plus) cause **system hangs and reboots** during manual tuning.
- **Root cause**: Large gaps (~16us) between tuning command response and
  data transmission. When CRC errors occur during tuning, code resets
  the host data circuit while data is still in-flight.
- **Failure mechanism**: Per IMX7ULP reference manual,
  RESET_DATA/RESET_ALL must not be issued during active data transfer.
  Resetting while data is in-flight clears the data circuit including
  ADMA/SDMA address, causing **data to be transmitted to incorrect
  memory address**.
- **Symptom**: System hang and reboot.

Record: Critical bug - system hang/reboot. DMA address corruption from
reset during active transfer. Hardware-documented requirement violated.
Specific SD card makes the timing gap visible.

### Step 1.4: Hidden Bug Fix Detection
This is NOT hidden - it's an explicit fix for system hangs. The commit
clearly describes a hardware requirement (per reference manual) that was
being violated, leading to DMA address corruption and system hangs.

Record: Explicit bug fix - system hang prevention. Not a disguised fix.

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

### Step 2.1: Inventory
- **Files changed**: 1 file (`drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-esdhc-imx.c`)
- **Lines added**: ~18 (2 for the define, 16 for the polling logic)
- **Lines removed**: 0
- **Functions modified**: `esdhc_reset()` - the core reset callback for
  this driver
- **Scope**: Single-file, single-function, surgical fix

Record: [sdhci-esdhc-imx.c +18/-0] [esdhc_reset() modified] [Single-file
surgical fix]

### Step 2.2: Code Flow Change
1. **New define**: `ESDHC_DATA_INHIBIT_WAIT_US 100000` (100ms timeout)
2. **Before**: `esdhc_reset()` directly called `sdhci_and_cqhci_reset()`
   without checking data transfer state
3. **After**: Before reset, if the reset mask includes
   `SDHCI_RESET_DATA` or `SDHCI_RESET_ALL`, poll `ESDHC_PRSSTAT`
   register waiting for `SDHCI_DATA_INHIBIT` to clear (indicating no
   active data transfer). Timeout at 100ms with a warning. Then proceed
   to reset.

Record: Added defensive wait-for-idle before data/full reset. 100ms
timeout with warning on failure. Non-blocking (proceeds even on
timeout).

### Step 2.3: Bug Mechanism
Category: **Hardware workaround / DMA corruption fix**
- The bug is a violation of hardware specification requirements (IMX7ULP
  reference manual)
- Resetting while `SDHCI_DATA_INHIBIT` is set clears ADMA/SDMA addresses
  mid-transfer
- Data goes to wrong memory address → system hang/reboot (effectively
  memory corruption)
- The fix polls the Present State register bit 1 (DATA_INHIBIT) before
  issuing reset
- Uses `readl_poll_timeout_atomic` with 2us polling interval and 100ms
  max wait

Record: [HW requirement violation → DMA address corruption → system
hang] [Fix: poll for data idle before reset]

### Step 2.4: Fix Quality
- **Obviously correct**: Yes. The reference manual explicitly requires
  waiting. The pattern of polling ESDHC_PRSSTAT is already used twice in
  this driver (lines 471, 1028).
- **Minimal/surgical**: Yes. Only adds the required wait before existing
  reset call.
- **Regression risk**: Very low. On timeout, it warns but still proceeds
  with reset (graceful degradation). The 100ms timeout is generous.
  Using `readl_poll_timeout_atomic` is appropriate since reset can be
  called from interrupt context.
- **Red flags**: None. Well-contained, uses established patterns from
  the same driver.

Record: High quality fix. Uses existing driver patterns. Graceful
timeout handling. Minimal regression risk.

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

### Step 3.1: Blame
- `esdhc_reset()` introduced in commit `0718e59ae259f7` by Russell King
  (2014-04-25), present since ~v3.16
- Modified by `fb1dec44c6750b` (Brian Norris, 2022-10-26) to use
  `sdhci_and_cqhci_reset`, present since v6.2
- The function has been stable in its current form since v6.2

Record: esdhc_reset() has existed since v3.16 (2014). Current form since
v6.2. Bug has been present since the function was introduced - the
hardware requirement was never respected.

### Step 3.2: No Fixes: tag present (expected).

### Step 3.3: File History
Recent changes to the file are mostly tuning-related fixes (manual
tuning, clock loopback, PM refactoring). The `esdhc_reset()` function
itself hasn't been touched recently (last change was the cqhci fix in
2022).

Record: No prerequisites identified. The fix is standalone.

### Step 3.4: Author
Luke Wang (ziniu.wang_1@nxp.com) is a regular NXP contributor with 14+
commits in the MMC subsystem and sdhci-esdhc-imx driver specifically.
He's contributed tuning improvements, PM refactoring, and other driver
fixes.

Record: Regular subsystem contributor from the hardware vendor (NXP).

### Step 3.5: Dependencies
- Uses `readl_poll_timeout_atomic` from `<linux/iopoll.h>` - already
  included in all stable versions
- Uses `ESDHC_PRSSTAT` and `SDHCI_DATA_INHIBIT` - both already defined
- Uses `SDHCI_RESET_DATA` and `SDHCI_RESET_ALL` - standard SDHCI defines
- Only dependency: `sdhci_and_cqhci_reset` (present since v6.2). For
  v5.15, the function uses `sdhci_reset` instead - minor backport
  adjustment needed.

Record: Fully standalone for v6.1+. Minor adjustment needed for v5.15
(different reset function name). All APIs/macros already available.

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH

### Step 4.1-4.5
I was unable to find the specific mailing list thread for this patch via
b4 dig (commit not in tree) or web searches. The patch was found
indirectly via the "1-bit bus width" series which built on top of the
file state after this patch was applied (blob `97461e20425d`).

The commit has strong review signals:
- **Reviewed-by** from Bough Chen (NXP maintainer of this driver, 30+
  commits)
- **Acked-by** from Adrian Hunter (SDHCI co-maintainer, 100+ SDHCI
  commits)
- **Signed-off-by** from Ulf Hansson (MMC subsystem maintainer who
  merged it)

Record: Could not find lore thread directly (commit not yet in tree).
But review chain is complete: hardware vendor reviewer + SDHCI
maintainer ACK + subsystem maintainer merge.

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

### Step 5.1: Functions Modified
- `esdhc_reset()` - the `.reset` callback in `sdhci_esdhc_ops`

### Step 5.2: Callers
`esdhc_reset` is called via `sdhci_do_reset()` (line 247 of sdhci.c)
through the ops->reset function pointer. `sdhci_do_reset` is called
from:
- `sdhci_reset_for_all()` - init, suspend/resume paths (SDHCI_RESET_ALL)
- `sdhci_reset_for_reason()` - error recovery, tuning abort, card
  removal, CQE recovery (SDHCI_RESET_CMD, SDHCI_RESET_DATA)
- These are called from tuning abort, data error paths, card removal,
  CQE recovery, and initialization

The fix specifically triggers on `SDHCI_RESET_DATA | SDHCI_RESET_ALL`,
which covers error recovery (data errors, request errors) and full
initialization.

Record: Called from multiple critical paths - error recovery, tuning
abort, card removal, init. High-traffic code path.

### Step 5.3-5.4: The affected code path is triggered during normal card
operations (tuning, error recovery). Any user of an i.MX SDHCI host
controller can trigger this.

### Step 5.5: Similar Patterns
The Freescale ESDHC of-driver (`sdhci-of-esdhc.c`) has a separate
`quirk_ignore_data_inhibit` for unreliable DATA_INHIBIT bits on some
controllers. The `readl_poll_timeout` pattern is already used twice in
this same driver for similar hardware waits.

Record: Pattern is consistent with existing driver practices.

## PHASE 6: STABLE TREE ANALYSIS

### Step 6.1: Buggy Code in Stable Trees
- `esdhc_reset()` exists in **all stable trees** (v5.15, v6.1, v6.6,
  v6.12, v6.19)
- The bug has been present since the function was introduced in v3.16
  (2014)
- IMX7ULP support was added before v5.15

Record: Bug exists in ALL active stable trees.

### Step 6.2: Backport Complications
- For v6.1, v6.6, v6.12, v6.19: Patch applies cleanly. `esdhc_reset()`
  is identical.
- For v5.15: Minor adjustment needed - function calls `sdhci_reset()`
  instead of `sdhci_and_cqhci_reset()`, but the added code goes BEFORE
  that call, so it's unaffected.

Record: Clean apply for v6.1+. Trivial adjustment for v5.15.

### Step 6.3: No related fixes already in stable for this issue.

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT

### Step 7.1
- **Subsystem**: drivers/mmc/host - MMC host controller drivers
- **Criticality**: IMPORTANT - MMC/SD cards are used for storage on
  embedded platforms, IoT devices, and Android devices running i.MX
  SoCs. System hangs on these platforms = production device failure.

### Step 7.2
The sdhci-esdhc-imx driver is actively maintained by NXP engineers. 28
changes between v6.6 and v6.19.

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

### Step 8.1: Affected Population
- Users of NXP i.MX SoCs with SDHCI host controllers (IMX7ULP
  specifically named, but the fix applies to all i.MX ESDHC variants)
- Embedded/IoT devices, industrial controllers, automotive platforms
  using NXP i.MX chips
- The bug is triggered with specific SD cards (Kingston Canvas Go! Plus
  mentioned) during tuning

### Step 8.2: Trigger Conditions
- Occurs during SD card tuning (happens on card initialization/re-
  initialization)
- Triggered when CRC errors occur during tuning while data has gaps in
  transmission
- Not every card triggers it - depends on card timing characteristics
- Can happen on any boot/card insertion with affected cards

### Step 8.3: Failure Mode Severity
- **System hang and reboot** = CRITICAL
- DMA writes to incorrect memory address = potential **memory
  corruption**
- The reset clears ADMA/SDMA addresses, so DMA writes to address 0 or
  stale address
- This is a hardware-documented requirement violation

Record: CRITICAL severity. System hang, reboot, potential memory
corruption.

### Step 8.4: Risk-Benefit Ratio
- **BENEFIT**: HIGH - prevents system hangs/reboots on NXP i.MX
  platforms with certain SD cards
- **RISK**: VERY LOW
  - ~18 lines added, single function, single file
  - Uses existing patterns from the same driver
  - Graceful timeout (warning + proceed) prevents any new hangs from the
    fix itself
  - `readl_poll_timeout_atomic` is safe for all calling contexts
  - Only adds a wait before an existing operation

Record: HIGH benefit / VERY LOW risk. Strongly favorable ratio.

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

### Step 9.1: Evidence Summary

**FOR backporting:**
1. Fixes **system hangs and reboots** (CRITICAL severity)
2. Fixes **DMA address corruption** from violating hardware
   specification
3. Small, surgical fix (~18 lines in one function, one file)
4. Uses existing patterns from the same driver (`readl_poll_timeout`)
5. Reviewed by NXP driver maintainer (haibo.chen), ACK'd by SDHCI co-
   maintainer (Adrian Hunter), merged by MMC maintainer (Ulf Hansson)
6. Author is NXP engineer with deep knowledge of the hardware
7. Bug exists in ALL active stable trees (code unchanged since v6.2)
8. Patch applies cleanly to v6.1+ with no modifications needed
9. Graceful degradation on timeout (warn + continue)
10. References hardware reference manual as justification

**AGAINST backporting:**
- No concrete signals against. The fix is well-contained and low-risk.

**UNRESOLVED:**
- Could not find the original lore thread (commit appears very
  recent/not yet merged)
- No Fixes: tag identifying original buggy commit (but bug has existed
  since 2014)

### Step 9.2: Stable Rules Checklist
1. **Obviously correct and tested?** YES - follows hardware manual
   requirement, reviewed by 3 maintainers, uses established driver
   patterns
2. **Fixes a real bug?** YES - system hangs and reboots on real hardware
   with real SD cards
3. **Important issue?** YES - system hang, reboot, DMA corruption =
   CRITICAL
4. **Small and contained?** YES - ~18 lines, single function, single
   file
5. **No new features/APIs?** CORRECT - no new features, just defensive
   hardware wait
6. **Can apply to stable?** YES - applies cleanly to v6.1+, minor
   adjustment for v5.15

### Step 9.3: Exception Categories
Not needed - this meets standard stable criteria as a critical bug fix.

### Step 9.4: Decision
This is a clear YES. It fixes a **critical** system hang/reboot caused
by violating a hardware-documented requirement, with a small, surgical,
well-reviewed patch that carries minimal regression risk.
