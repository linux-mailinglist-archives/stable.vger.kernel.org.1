My name is Mrs Lovelyn Raya  from Indonesia

I know that this message might come to you as a surprise because we
don't know each other nor have we ever met before but accept it with
an open and positive mind. I have a Very important request that made
me to contact you; I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer disease which
doctors have confirmed and announced to me that i have just a few days
to leave, Now that I'm ending the race like this, without any family
members and no child, I just came across your email contact from my
personal search.

I'm a business woman from Indonesia dealing with gold exports here
in the Republic of Burkina Faso. I have decided to hand over the sum
of ($10.5 Million Dollar) in my account to you for the help of
orphanage homes/the needy once in your location to fulfill my wish on
earth. But before handing over my data's to you, kindly assure me that
you will take only 50% of the money and share the rest to orphanage
homes/the needy once in your country, Return to enable me forward to
you the bank contact details.

Your early response will be appreciated.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs Lovelyn Raya
