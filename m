[ Upstream commit 531df041f2a5296174abd8292d298eb62fe1ea97 ]

Normally resources are evicted on dGPUs at suspend or hibernate and
on APUs at hibernate.  These steps are unnecessary when using the S4
callbacks to put the system into S5.

## COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

### What This Commit Fixes

This commit addresses an **unnecessary performance penalty and potential
reliability issue** during system shutdown (S5 - complete poweroff).
Specifically:

1. **The Problem**: Some systems use S4 (hibernate) callbacks to
   transition to S5 (complete poweroff). When this happens, the AMD GPU
   driver's `amdgpu_device_evict_resources()` function unnecessarily
   evicts all VRAM resources even though the system is about to be
   completely powered off.

2. **Why This Matters**: Evicting VRAM resources is an expensive
   operation that:
   - Moves graphics memory contents to system RAM or swap
   - Can cause significant delays during shutdown
   - Is completely wasteful when the system is powering off anyway
     (resources don't need to be preserved)
   - Can fail under memory pressure, potentially causing shutdown issues

3. **The Fix**: The commit adds a simple 4-line check in
   `amdgpu_device_evict_resources()` at line 5076:
  ```c
  /* No need to evict when going to S5 through S4 callbacks */
  if (system_state == SYSTEM_POWER_OFF)
  return 0;
  ```
  This check uses the kernel-wide `system_state` variable (which is set
  to `SYSTEM_POWER_OFF` when shutting down) to detect S5 transitions and
  skip the unnecessary eviction.

### Code Context and Change Analysis

**Location**: `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_device.c:5067-5091`

The `amdgpu_device_evict_resources()` function is called from
`amdgpu_device_prepare()` (the PM prepare callback) and handles VRAM
eviction during power state transitions. The function already has logic
to optimize eviction:

**Existing checks** (before this commit):
- Line 5072: Skip eviction for APUs unless going to S4 (hibernate)

**New check** (added by this commit):
- Line 5076: Skip eviction when `system_state == SYSTEM_POWER_OFF`
  (S5/poweroff)

**Placement**: The new check is strategically placed AFTER the APU check
but BEFORE the actual `amdgpu_ttm_evict_resources()` call, ensuring it
catches all S5 transitions for both dGPUs and APUs.

### Historical Context and Related Changes

My investigation revealed a complex history of power management
optimization in the AMD GPU driver:

1. **Commit 62498733d4c4f** (2021): "rework S3/S4/S0ix state handling" -
   Established the current flag-based approach for tracking power states

2. **Commit 2965e6355dcdf** (Nov 2024): "Add Suspend/Hibernate
   notification callback support" - Added PM notifier to evict resources
   early (before tasks are frozen) to improve reliability during memory
   pressure. This sets `in_s4 = true` when `PM_HIBERNATION_PREPARE` is
   received.

3. **Commit ce8f7d95899c2** (May 2025): "Revert 'drm/amd: Stop evicting
   resources on APUs in suspend'" - Reverted an optimization that broke
   S4 because it set mutually exclusive flags. The revert message
   explicitly states: *"This breaks S4 because we end up setting the
   s3/s0ix flags even when we are entering s4 since prepare is used by
   both flows."*

4. **This commit 531df041f2a52** (Aug 2025): Addresses the remaining
   issue where S4 callbacks are used for S5 transitions.

This progression shows a careful, iterative refinement of power
management handling, with each commit addressing specific edge cases
while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Why S4 Callbacks Are Used for S5

On some systems, the kernel uses the hibernate (S4) power management
callbacks even when performing a complete poweroff (S5). This is a valid
kernel behavior where:
- `PM_HIBERNATION_PREPARE` notification is sent → sets `in_s4 = true`
- `amdgpu_device_prepare()` is called → calls
  `amdgpu_device_evict_resources()`
- But the system is actually going to S5, not S4
- `system_state` is set to `SYSTEM_POWER_OFF` to indicate complete
  shutdown

Without this fix, resources are evicted unnecessarily, causing shutdown
delays.

### Pattern Validation - Similar Checks in Other Drivers

The use of `system_state == SYSTEM_POWER_OFF` to optimize shutdown is a
**well-established pattern** in the kernel. My investigation found
identical checks in numerous network drivers:

**From `drivers/net/ethernet/intel/`:**
- `e1000/e1000_main.c:5206`: `if (system_state == SYSTEM_POWER_OFF) {
  pci_wake_from_d3(); pci_set_power_state(); }`
- `e100.c:3083`: `if (system_state == SYSTEM_POWER_OFF)
  __e100_power_off()`
- `igb/igb_main.c:9680`: `if (system_state == SYSTEM_POWER_OFF) {
  pci_wake_from_d3(); pci_set_power_state(); }`
- `igc/igc_main.c:7613`, `ixgbe/ixgbe_main.c:7646`,
  `i40e/i40e_main.c:16563`, `ice/ice_main.c:5486`,
  `iavf/iavf_main.c:5676`, `idpf/idpf_main.c:99` - all use the same
  pattern

This demonstrates that the approach is **proven, safe, and widely
accepted** in the kernel community for optimizing shutdown paths.

### Testing and Review Evidence

**Strong testing and review signals:**
- **Tested-by**: Eric Naim <dnaim@cachyos.org> (community testing)
- **Acked-by**: Alex Deucher (AMD DRM subsystem maintainer)
- **CC'd individuals from**:
  - Canonical (Ubuntu) - AceLan Kao
  - NVIDIA - Kai-Heng Feng
  - Lenovo - Mark Pearson
  - Community members - Denis Benato, Merthan Karakaş

The CC list suggests this issue was reported by or affects users across
multiple vendors and distributions, indicating **broad real-world
impact**.

### Verification of No Follow-up Issues

My investigation confirmed:
- ✅ **No reverts**: `git log --grep="Revert.*531df041f2a52"` returned no
  results
- ✅ **No fixes**: `git log --grep="Fixes.*531df041f2a52"` returned no
  results
- ✅ **No follow-up changes**: Only one commit after this one in the file
  (f8b367e6fa171 about S0ix, unrelated)
- ✅ **No GitLab issues**: The commit references no bug tracker issues,
  suggesting it's a proactive optimization

The commit has been in mainline since September 2025 with no reported
problems.

### Risk Assessment

**Regression Risk: VERY LOW**

1. **Narrow scope**: Only affects the shutdown (S5) code path
   - Does NOT affect suspend (S3)
   - Does NOT affect hibernate (S4)
   - Does NOT affect runtime PM
   - Does NOT affect normal operation

2. **Conservative logic**: Only skips work when `system_state ==
   SYSTEM_POWER_OFF`
   - This is a definitive kernel state set only during shutdown
   - No ambiguity about when to apply the optimization

3. **Fail-safe behavior**: If the check somehow fails, the worst case is
   the old behavior (unnecessary eviction during shutdown) - no
   functionality is lost

4. **Proven pattern**: Identical logic exists in numerous other drivers
   without issues

5. **Well-placed in control flow**: The check is after other
   optimizations (APU check) and before the expensive operation, making
   it easy to understand and verify

**Potential Issues Considered and Dismissed:**
- ❌ "Could break hibernate" - No, the check is `system_state ==
  SYSTEM_POWER_OFF` which is only set for S5, not S4
- ❌ "Could break suspend" - No, suspend doesn't set `system_state` to
  `SYSTEM_POWER_OFF`
- ❌ "Could leak resources" - No, resources don't need to be preserved
  during poweroff
- ❌ "Could cause hardware issues" - No, skipping eviction during
  poweroff is safe; the hardware will be reset on next boot

### Benefits to Stable Users

Users on stable kernels will experience:

1. **Faster shutdowns**: No unnecessary VRAM eviction delays
2. **More reliable shutdowns**: Removes a potential failure point during
   shutdown under memory pressure
3. **Better user experience**: Shutdown is a common operation that users
   notice
4. **Resource savings**: CPU cycles and memory bandwidth not wasted on
   pointless operations

### Stable Tree Criteria Evaluation

Checking against kernel stable tree rules:

| Criterion | Met? | Explanation |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Fixes important bug | ✅ YES | Unnecessary shutdown delays and
potential failures |
| Relatively small and contained | ✅ YES | Only 4 lines added in one
function |
| No clear side effects | ✅ YES | Only affects S5 path, no other paths
touched |
| No major architectural changes | ✅ YES | Simple conditional check
using existing infrastructure |
| No new features | ✅ YES | Just optimization/fix for existing
functionality |
| Minimal regression risk | ✅ YES | Very narrow scope, proven pattern,
conservative logic |
| Confined to subsystem | ✅ YES | Only touches AMD GPU driver |
| Has testing/review | ✅ YES | Tested-by tag, maintainer Ack, multiple
interested parties |

**Result: Meets ALL stable tree backporting criteria**

### Supporting Code Evidence

From `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_device.c`:

**Before the commit**, the eviction flow was:
```c
static int amdgpu_device_evict_resources(struct amdgpu_device *adev)
{
    int ret;

    /* No need to evict vram on APUs unless going to S4 */
    if (!adev->in_s4 && (adev->flags & AMD_IS_APU))
        return 0;

    // UNNECESSARY EVICTION HAPPENS HERE DURING S5
    ret = amdgpu_ttm_evict_resources(adev, TTM_PL_VRAM);
    ...
}
```

**After the commit**:
```c
static int amdgpu_device_evict_resources(struct amdgpu_device *adev)
{
    int ret;

    /* No need to evict vram on APUs unless going to S4 */
    if (!adev->in_s4 && (adev->flags & AMD_IS_APU))
        return 0;

    /* No need to evict when going to S5 through S4 callbacks */
    if (system_state == SYSTEM_POWER_OFF)
        return 0;  // SKIP UNNECESSARY WORK

    ret = amdgpu_ttm_evict_resources(adev, TTM_PL_VRAM);
    ...
}
```

The change is surgical, clear, and easy to verify.

### Conclusion

This commit is an **ideal candidate for stable backporting**:

- ✅ Small, targeted fix (4 lines)
- ✅ Addresses real user-facing issue (shutdown delays)
- ✅ Very low regression risk (narrow scope, proven pattern)
- ✅ Well-tested and reviewed (Tested-by, Acked-by, multiple CCs)
- ✅ No follow-up fixes needed (clean mainline history)
- ✅ Follows established kernel patterns (same check in many drivers)
- ✅ Meets all stable tree criteria
- ✅ Benefits stable users (faster, more reliable shutdowns)
