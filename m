No, I take it back, it is unreasonable :)

At runtime, there never is a uninitialized use of this pointer, the
first time it is used, it is intended to be filled in if this is a "boot
rom patch":
	ret = cxacru_find_firmware(instance, "bp", &bp);

Then if that call fails, the function exits, great.

Then later on, this is called:
	cxacru_upload_firmware(instance, fw, bp);
so either bp IS valid, or it's still uninitialized, fair enough.

But then cxacru_upload_firmware() does the same check for "is this a
boot rom patch" and only then does it reference the variable.

And when it references it, it does NOT check if it is valid or not, so
even if you do pre-initialize this to NULL, surely some other static
checker is going to come along and say "Hey, you just dereferenced a
NULL pointer, this needs to be fixed!" when that too is just not true at
all.

So the logic here is all "safe" for now, and if you set this to NULL,
you are just papering over the fact that it is right, AND setting us up
to get another patch that actually does nothing, while feeling like the
submitter just fixed a security bug, demanding a CVE for an impossible
code path :)

So let's leave this for now because:

As gcc can't handle this either, it seems that clang also can't handle
it.  So turning this on for the kernel surely is going to trip it up in
other places than just this one driver.

If you _really_ want to fix this, refactor the code to be more sane and
obvious from a C parsing standpoint, but really, it isn't that complex
for a human to read and understand, and I see why it was written this
way.

As for the UB argument, bah, I don't care, sane compilers will do the
right thing, i.e. pass in the uninitialized value, or if we turned on
the 0-fill stack option, will be NULL anyway, otherwise why do we have
that option if not to "solve" the UB issue?).
