I have read through the last mails without commenting. I admit: I do not 
yet get what is wrong here? A checksum was miscalculated? Is this a 
regular thing to happen when using RDB disks with Linux partitions?

I do not yet get how this issue happens. What are the steps to reproduce 
it? And how likely is it to run into it?

How many end users are you speaking of?

Back then I thought I was the only one using a hard disk with mixed 
Amiga/Linux RDB setup.
