Umm, I don't think you know which vmalloc allocation a page came from
today?  I've sent patches to add that information before, but they were
rejected.  In fact, I don't think we know even _that_ a page belongs to
vmalloc today, do we?  Yes, we know that the page is accounted, and
which memcg it belongs to ... but nothing more.

I actually want to improve this, without adding additional overhead.
What I'm working on right now (before I got waylaid by this bug) is:

+struct choir {
+       struct kref refcount;
+       unsigned int nr;
+       struct page *pages[] __counted_by(nr);
+};

and rewriting vmalloc to be based on choirs instead of its own pages.
One thing I've come to realise today is that the obj_cgroup pointer
needs to be in the choir and not in the vm_struct so that we uncharge the
allocation when the choir refcount drops to 0, not when the allocation
is unmapped.

A regular choir allocation will (today) mark the pages in it as being
allocated to a choir (and thus not having their own refcount / mapcount),
but I'll give vmalloc a way to mark the pages as specifically being
from vmalloc.

There's a lot of moving parts to this ... it's proving quite tricky!

OK, I'll send a patch to do that.
