For obvious reasons, we can not take a patch only for one older kernel
and not a newer (or the older ones if possible), otherwise you will have
a regression when you move forward to the new version as you will be
doing eventually.

So for that reason alone, we can not take this patch, NOR should you
want us to.

Odd quoting, please fix your email client :)

So no one has hit this on any 5.15 or newer devices?  I find that really
hard to believe given the number of those devices in the world.  So what
is unique about your platform that you are hitting this and no one else
is?

Whenever we take one-off patches, 90% of the time it causes problems,
both with the fact that the patch is usually buggy, AND the fact that it
now will cause merge conflicts going forward.  40+ patches is nothing in
stable patch acceptance, please try that first as you want us to be able
to maintain these kernels well for your devices over time, right?

So please do that first.  Only after proof that that would not work
should you even consider a one-off patch.

Then how was it removed in newer kernels at all?  Did we just drop
support for that hardware?  What happens when you move to a newer kernel
on your hardware, does it stop working?  Based on what I have seen with
some Android devices, they seem to work just fine on Linus's tree today,
so what is unique about your platform that is going to break and not
work anymore?

So this is for a 32bit ARM system only?  Not 64bit?  If so, why is this
also being submitted to the Android kernel tree which does not support
32bit ARM at all?

And again, does your system not work properly on 6.16?  If not, why not
fix that first?

thanks,
