Correct, but this was how I found the issue and motivation for
backporting the fixes including yours which was not marked for stable.

I'm not saying it's buggy, I'm explaining that the identified issue was
recently fixed partially.

Relax. I'm not blaming you for doing anything wrong here.

I sent a fix for the same issues you addressed and Viresh let me know
that he had already merged a fix for most of the issues:

Fair enough, I could have used dependency notation for this one.

Let me do that in v3.
