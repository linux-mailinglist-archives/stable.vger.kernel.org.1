6.6-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: "Steven Rostedt (Google)" <rostedt@goodmis.org>

commit 88903daecacf03b1e5636e1b5f18bda5b07030fc upstream.

The logic to free the eventfs_inode (ei) use to set is_freed and clear the
"dentry" field under the eventfs_mutex. But that changed when a race was
found where the ei->dentry needed to be cleared when the last dput() was
called on it. But there was still logic that checked if ei->dentry was not
NULL and is_freed is set, and would warn if it was.

But since that situation was changed and the ei->dentry isn't cleared
until the last dput() is called on it while the ei->is_freed is set, do
not test for that condition anymore, and change the comments to reflect
that.
