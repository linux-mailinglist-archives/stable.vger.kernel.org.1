Conceptually I agree, but do we have any data indicating that there's
practical benefit to this complication?

Yes, PWRSTS_RET_ON effectively means that Linux has "dropped its vote"
on the GDSC and its parents. But with the caveat that we assume when
going to ON again some state will have been retained.

Doesn't GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON imply that the parent will also be always
on?

No, it's not working around limitations in the consumer drivers.

It does work around a limitation in the API, in that the consumer
drivers can't indicate in which cases they would be willing to restore
and in which cases they would prefer retention. This is something the
downstream solution has had, but we don't have a sensible and generic
way to provide this.

Keeping GDSCs in retention is a huge gain when it comes to the time it
takes to resume the system after being in low power. PCIe is a good
example of this, where the GDSC certainly support entering OFF, at the
cost of tearing link and all down.
