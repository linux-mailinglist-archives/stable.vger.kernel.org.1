I think you should make clear at least you believe you understand the
consequences of your patches including user impacts before sending your patches
without RFC tag.  I'd suggest you to take more time on making such
preparational confidences and/or discussions _before_ sending non-RFC patches.
You're nver lagging.  Take your time.

It is not the only case that time_after_eq() can be evaluated to false.  Maybe
you're saying only about the just-after-boot running case?  If so, please
clarify.  You and I know the context, but others may not.  I hope the commit
message be nicer for them.

Thank you for clarifying your view.  The code is behaving in the way you
described above.  It is because damon_set_effective_quota(), which sets the
esz, is called only when the time_after_eq() call returns true.

However, this is a bug rather than an intended behavior.  The current behavior
is making the first charging window just be wasted without doing nothing.

Probably the bug was introduced by the commit that introduced esz.

Also please make it easier to read for more human people.

Again, if there is anything unclear, let's do discussions before sending
non-RFC patches.

Or, total_charged_sz is also overflows and bcome 0.

It's not necessarily when charging occurs but when damon_adjust_quota() is
called.  More technically speaking once per the scheme's apply interval.

I'm ok to completely drop the explanation.  But if you are gonna mention it
partially, please clarify.

This is not about English skill but the commit "message".  Your English skill
is good and probably betetr than mine.  But I ad a difficult time at reviewing
your patch, and feeling it could been easier if the message was nicer.

So what I'm saying is that I tink this patch's commit message can be more nice
to readers.


Thanks,
