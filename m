One slightly interesting thing was that neither the Maxtor or the Samsung
drive reported support for Host-Initiated Power Management (HIPM).

Both drives supported Device-Initiated Power Management (DIPM), and we
could see that DIPM was enabled on both drives.

We already know that LPM works on the Samsung drive with an Intel AHCI
controller. (But since the device does not report support for HIPM, even
on Intel, only DIPM will be used/enabled.)

I'm still not 100% sure with the best way forward.

The ATI SATA controller reports that it supports ALPM (i.e. also HIPM).
It also reports support for slumber and partial, which means that it must
support both host initiated and device initiated requests to these states.
(See AHCI spec 3.1.1 - Offset 00h: CAP â€“ HBA Capabilities,
CAP.PSC and CAP.SSC fields.)

Considering that DIPM seems to work fine on the Maxtor drive, I guess your
initial suggestion of a Samsung only quirk which only disables LPM on ATI
is the best way?

It seems that ATI and Samsung must have interpreted some spec differently
from each other, otherwise, I don't understand why this combination
specificially seems to be so extremely bad, ATI + anything other than
Samsung, or Samsung + anything other than ATI seems to work.


Kind regards,
Niklas
