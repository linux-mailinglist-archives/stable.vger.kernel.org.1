[ Upstream commit f81aa834bfa91c827f290b62a245e23c5ad2813c ]

The regulatory domain information was initialized every time the
FW was loaded and the device was restarted. This was unnecessary
and useless as at this stage the wiphy channels information was
not setup yet so while the regulatory domain was set to the wiphy,
the channel information was not updated.

In case that a specific MCC was configured during FW initialization
then following updates with this MCC are ignored, and thus the
wiphy channels information is left with information not matching
the regulatory domain.

This commit moves the regulatory domain initialization to after the
operational firmware is started, i.e., after the wiphy channels were
configured and the regulatory information is needed.

**YES**

This commit should be backported to stable kernel trees. Here's my
extensive analysis:

## Bug Fix Nature

The commit fixes a real bug where regulatory domain information and
wiphy channel configurations become mismatched. Specifically, from the
commit message:

1. **Timing Issue**: The regulatory domain was being initialized in
   `iwl_mld_load_fw()` before wiphy channels were properly configured
2. **Update Failures**: When a specific MCC (Mobile Country Code) was
   configured during FW initialization, subsequent updates with the same
   MCC would be ignored, leaving channel information inconsistent with
   the regulatory domain

## Code Analysis

The changes are minimal and low-risk:
- **Removed from `iwl_mld_load_fw()`**: Lines removing the
  `iwl_mld_init_mcc()` call and its error handling
- **Added to `iwl_mld_start_fw()`**: The same call is added after
  `iwl_mld_config_fw()`, ensuring proper initialization order

## Comparison with Similar Commits

Most relevant is Similar Commit #4 (marked YES for backporting), which
addressed regulatory domain update issues when firmware starts. That
commit fixed the handling of `MCC_RESP_ILLEGAL` responses to ensure
channel lists were properly updated - a closely related regulatory
compliance issue.

## Stable Kernel Criteria

This commit meets the stable kernel requirements:
1. **Fixes a real bug**: Regulatory domain/channel mismatch is a serious
   issue affecting wireless compliance
2. **Small and contained**: Only moves a function call to the correct
   initialization sequence
3. **Low regression risk**: No new logic introduced, just reordering
   existing initialization
4. **Important functionality**: Regulatory compliance is critical for
   legal wireless operation
5. **Clear root cause**: The issue and fix are well-understood and
   documented

## Repository Context

From examining the kernel repository, I found that regulatory domain
initialization has been an ongoing concern in iwlwifi, with multiple
fixes addressing timing and synchronization issues. The `lar_regdom_set`
flag is critical for preventing operations (like scans) before
regulatory setup is complete.

The fix ensures that `iwl_mld_init_mcc()` is called after the firmware
is fully configured (`iwl_mld_config_fw()`), which is the proper time
when wiphy channels are set up and ready to receive regulatory updates.

This is precisely the type of bug fix that stable kernels should receive
- it corrects a specific functional issue without introducing
architectural changes or new features.
