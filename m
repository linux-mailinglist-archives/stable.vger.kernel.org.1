Ah, right.  I really don't like these exported locked/unlocked
interfaces because pci_bus_sem is internal to the PCI core, and the
caller shouldn't need to know or be able to specify whether it is held
or not.  They exist for now, but I think we should try to get rid of
them.

Makes good sense.  There's no real machine cost to the unused one; I'm
more concerned about the human cost here.

I think you did the right thing.
