Here the auto-generated DT property (Vivado 2025.1) for our design:

         interrupt-map = <0 0 0 1 &psv_pcie_intc_0 1>,
                         <0 0 0 2 &psv_pcie_intc_0 2>,
                         <0 0 0 3 &psv_pcie_intc_0 3>,
                         <0 0 0 4 &psv_pcie_intc_0 4>;

So we should manually "fix" the auto-generated DT instead? I would
rather like to skip such a step, as this is error prone with frequent
updates from the FPGA bistream design.

Thanks,
Stefan
