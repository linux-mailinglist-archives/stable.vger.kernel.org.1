After fixing the issue described in this patch,
we can replace with a new member of 'struct pci_endpoint_test' instead.

I think that it's better to prepare new patch series.

There is something ambiguous about the behavior for me.

The test->irq_type has a state "UNDEFINED".
After issueing "Clear IRQ", test->irq_type becomes "UNDEFINED" currently,
and all tests with IRQs will fail until new test->irq_type is set.

If SET_IRQTYPE is AUTO, how will test->irq_type be set?

Thank you,
