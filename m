[ Upstream commit f93836b236773862e9ee268a82e3614caf77ea01 ]

The TRENDnet TUC-ET2G V2.0 is an RTL8156B based 2.5G Ethernet controller.

Add the vendor and product ID values to the driver. This makes Ethernet
work with the adapter.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## Phase 1: Commit Message Forensics
Step 1.1 Record: Subsystem `net: usb: r8152`; action verb `add`; claimed
intent: add TRENDnet TUC-ET2G v2.0 USB device ID so the existing `r8152`
driver binds to the adapter.

Step 1.2 Record: Tags present:
- `Signed-off-by: Aleksander Jan Bajkowski <olek2@wp.pl>`
- `Reviewed-by: Andrew Lunn <andrew@lunn.ch>`
- `Reviewed-by: Birger Koblitz <mail@birger-koblitz.de>`
- `Link: https://patch.msgid.link/20260430213435.21821-1-olek2@wp.pl`
- `Signed-off-by: Jakub Kicinski <kuba@kernel.org>`

No `Fixes:`, `Reported-by:`, `Tested-by:`, or `Cc:
stable@vger.kernel.org` tag was present. Absence of those tags is not a
negative signal here.

Step 1.3 Record: The body describes a real hardware support failure:
TRENDnet TUC-ET2G V2.0 is RTL8156B-based, but without its USB
vendor/product ID in `rtl8152_table`, Ethernet does not work with that
adapter. No affected kernel versions are named.

Step 1.4 Record: This is not a hidden memory/synchronization bug. It is
an explicit new USB device ID addition to an existing driver, which is a
stable exception category.

## Phase 2: Diff Analysis
Step 2.1 Record: One file changed: `drivers/net/usb/r8152.c`, `+1/-0`.
No function body changed. The modified object is `rtl8152_table`. Scope:
single-file surgical device-ID addition.

Step 2.2 Record: Before the change, the table contained TRENDnet
`0xe02b` but not `0xe02c`, so USB matching would not select `r8152` for
`20f4:e02c`. After the change, `USB_DEVICE(VENDOR_ID_TRENDNET, 0xe02c)`
is matched by the driver table used by both `rtl8152_driver.id_table`
and `rtl8152_cfgselector_driver.id_table`.

Step 2.3 Record: Bug category is hardware enablement / USB device ID
addition. It does not touch error paths, locking, reference counts,
memory safety, or public APIs.

Step 2.4 Record: The fix is obviously correct if the ID maps to RTL8156B
hardware. I verified the device identity externally: WikiDevi lists TUC-
ET2G v2.0R as USB ID `20f4:e02c` with Realtek RTL8156B, and TRENDnet’s
own support page confirms the TUC-ET2G v2 product. Regression risk is
very low; existing devices are unaffected unless another incompatible
device uses the same exact USB ID.

## Phase 3: Git History Investigation
Step 3.1 Record: `git blame` around the table showed the existing
TRENDnet `0xe02b` entry came from `15fba71533bc` and the new `0xe02c`
line comes from `f93836b23677`. The table terminator dates back to
`ac718b69301c`. The “bug” is not introduced by a code commit; it is the
absence of a product-specific ID for existing supported silicon.

Step 3.2 Record: No `Fixes:` tag, so there is no introducing commit to
follow.

Step 3.3 Record: Recent related history includes `15fba71533bc` adding
the first TRENDnet TUC-ET2G ID and `dc9c67820f81` adding a TP-Link ID.
The candidate is standalone on trees that already have
`VENDOR_ID_TRENDNET`.

Step 3.4 Record: The author has at least one prior `r8152` device-ID
commit, `848b09d53d92` for Dell Alienware AW1022z. The patch was
reviewed by Andrew Lunn and Birger Koblitz and applied by Jakub
Kicinski.

Step 3.5 Record: Dependency found: `VENDOR_ID_TRENDNET` was introduced
by `15fba71533bc`, and `git merge-base --is-ancestor` confirms that
commit is an ancestor of `f93836b23677`. Mainline release tags `v5.15`,
`v6.1`, `v6.6`, `v6.12`, and `v6.19` lack `VENDOR_ID_TRENDNET`, while
`v7.0-rc3` has it. Older stable backports therefore need either
`15fba71533bc` first or a small backport adjustment adding `#define
VENDOR_ID_TRENDNET 0x20f4`.

## Phase 4: Mailing List And External Research
Step 4.1 Record: `b4 dig -c f93836b23677` found the original patch
submission by patch-id. `b4 dig -a` reported the accepted one-patch
submission at `20260430213435.21821-1-olek2@wp.pl`; `b4` also found an
earlier identical submission from
`20260426214909.3426105-1-olek2@wp.pl`. The earlier thread had Andrew
Lunn asking for repost after netdev opened and giving his `Reviewed-by`.
No NAK or technical objection found.

Step 4.2 Record: `b4 dig -w` showed the patch was sent to netdev
maintainers/lists and USB networking lists, including Andrew Lunn, David
Miller, Eric Dumazet, Jakub Kicinski, Paolo Abeni, Realtek contacts,
`linux-usb`, `netdev`, and `linux-kernel`. `MAINTAINERS` confirms those
netdev maintainers for `NETWORKING DRIVERS`, and `drivers/net/usb/` is
under `USB NETWORKING DRIVERS`.

Step 4.3 Record: No separate bug report or `Reported-by` tag. External
hardware verification found TUC-ET2G v2.0R as `20f4:e02c` / RTL8156B.

Step 4.4 Record: This is a single-patch submission, not a multi-patch
fix series. The only practical dependency for older trees is the
TRENDnet vendor define from the prior TUC-ET2G ID commit.

Step 4.5 Record: WebFetch to lore was blocked by Anubis. WebSearch did
not find stable-specific discussion for `f93836b23677` or the patch
message ID. No stable objection found.

## Phase 5: Code Semantic Analysis
Step 5.1 Record: No functions modified. Modified data structure:
`rtl8152_table`.

Step 5.2 Record: `rtl8152_table` is referenced by
`MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(usb, rtl8152_table)`, `rtl8152_driver.id_table`,
and `rtl8152_cfgselector_driver.id_table`. Matching devices enter the
normal USB probe path via `rtl8152_probe`.

Step 5.3 Record: The relevant probe path checks vendor-specific
interface class, `rtl_check_vendor_ok`, `rtl8152_get_version`, then
calls `rtl8152_probe_once`. The config selector uses `__rtl_get_hw_ver`.
This patch adds no new calls.

Step 5.4 Record: Reachability is USB device enumeration: plugging in or
booting with the adapter attached. It is not a remote or syscall-
triggered security issue.

Step 5.5 Record: Similar pattern exists throughout the same table for
Realtek, Lenovo, TP-Link, D-Link, Dell, ASUS, and earlier TRENDnet IDs.
`git log -S'0xe02c'` found no prior `0xe02c` entry in the checked
history.

## Phase 6: Stable Tree Analysis
Step 6.1 Record: Checked mainline release tags `v5.15`, `v6.1`, `v6.6`,
`v6.12`, and `v6.19`: all contain `0x8156` and RTL8156B version
handling, but not the TRENDnet `0xe02c` ID. This means the supported
chipset path exists in those releases, but the product-specific match is
missing.

Step 6.2 Record: Backport difficulty is low. It applies cleanly to trees
with `VENDOR_ID_TRENDNET` / `0xe02b`; older bases need a minor
context/define adjustment or the prior TRENDnet ID patch.

Step 6.3 Record: No alternate local fix for `0xe02c` was found. No
stable-specific replacement fix was verified.

## Phase 7: Subsystem And Maintainer Context
Step 7.1 Record: Subsystem is `drivers/net/usb`, USB Ethernet networking
driver. Criticality: driver-specific, important for users of this
hardware, not core-kernel-wide.

Step 7.2 Record: The file is active, with recent `r8152` feature and fix
commits, but this change is isolated to the USB ID table and does not
depend on recent functional refactoring except the vendor
define/backport context noted above.

## Phase 8: Impact And Risk
Step 8.1 Record: Affected users are systems with TRENDnet TUC-ET2G V2.0
and `CONFIG_USB_RTL8152`.

Step 8.2 Record: Trigger is common for affected users: adapter insertion
or boot with the adapter connected. Not remotely triggerable; physical
USB access is needed.

Step 8.3 Record: Failure mode is device non-binding / Ethernet
unavailable. Severity is not crash/security-critical, but it is a real
user-visible hardware functionality failure.

Step 8.4 Record: Benefit is high for affected stable users because it
makes the adapter work with an already-supported RTL8156B driver. Risk
is very low: one table entry, no behavior change for existing IDs.

## Phase 9: Final Synthesis
Evidence for backporting:
- New USB device ID for existing driver and already-supported RTL8156B
  silicon.
- Fixes a real user-visible failure: Ethernet does not work with this
  adapter.
- One-line, single-file, no API or behavior change for existing
  hardware.
- Reviewed by Andrew Lunn and Birger Koblitz; applied by Jakub Kicinski.
- Hardware identity verified as TRENDnet `20f4:e02c` / RTL8156B.

Evidence against backporting:
- Not a crash, data corruption, security, or deadlock fix.
- Older stable bases may need the prior `VENDOR_ID_TRENDNET` definition
  or a tiny backport adjustment.

Unresolved:
- I did not verify every active stable branch state directly; I verified
  mainline release tags and the dependency relationship. Lore WebFetch
  was blocked, but `b4` successfully fetched the thread.

Stable rules checklist:
1. Obviously correct and tested? Yes, one matching-table entry;
   reviewed; hardware ID verified.
2. Fixes a real bug affecting users? Yes, adapter does not bind/work
   without the ID.
3. Important issue? Yes under the stable “new device IDs” exception,
   though not crash/security.
4. Small and contained? Yes, one insertion in one file.
5. No new features/APIs? Yes, no API or behavioral change except
   matching this USB device.
6. Can apply to stable trees? Yes with low difficulty; older trees may
   need `VENDOR_ID_TRENDNET`.

Exception category: New USB device ID for an existing driver. This is a
standard stable-appropriate exception.

## Verification
- [Phase 1] Parsed commit `f93836b236773862e9ee268a82e3614caf77ea01`
  with `git show`; confirmed subject, body, tags, and `+1/-0` diff.
- [Phase 2] Compared `git diff f938^..f938`; confirmed only `{
  USB_DEVICE(VENDOR_ID_TRENDNET, 0xe02c) }` is added.
- [Phase 3] Ran `git blame` around `rtl8152_table`; confirmed existing
  `0xe02b` from `15fba71533bc` and new `0xe02c` from `f93836b23677`.
- [Phase 3] Ran `git merge-base --is-ancestor 15fba71533bc
  f93836b23677`; confirmed the vendor define dependency is in the
  candidate’s ancestry.
- [Phase 3] Checked release tags `v5.15`, `v6.1`, `v6.6`, `v6.12`,
  `v6.19`, `v7.0-rc3`, `v7.1-rc3`; confirmed older release tags have
  RTL8156/RTL_VER_13 support but lack TRENDnet IDs until `v7.0-rc3`.
- [Phase 4] Ran `b4 dig -c`, `b4 dig -a`, and `b4 dig -w`; confirmed
  patch-id match, one-patch submission, recipients, and
  review/application thread.
- [Phase 4] Read full `b4 mbox` threads; confirmed Andrew Lunn review on
  repost request, Birger Koblitz review, and patchwork notification that
  Jakub applied it.
- [Phase 4] WebFetch to lore was blocked by Anubis; external GitHub
  commit fetch confirmed the commit metadata and diff.
- [Phase 4] WebFetch of WikiDevi and TRENDnet pages verified TUC-ET2G v2
  hardware identity; WikiDevi specifically listed USB ID `20f4:e02c` and
  RTL8156B.
- [Phase 5] Searched `rtl8152_table` references; confirmed use by
  `MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE`, `rtl8152_driver.id_table`, and
  `rtl8152_cfgselector_driver.id_table`.
- [Phase 5] Read `rtl8152_probe` and config selector code; confirmed
  affected path is USB enumeration/probe, with no changed runtime logic.
- [Phase 7] Checked `MAINTAINERS`; confirmed netdev maintainers and
  `drivers/net/usb/` list coverage.
- [Phase 8] Checked `drivers/net/usb/Kconfig`; confirmed affected
  configuration is `CONFIG_USB_RTL8152`.

This is exactly the kind of low-risk new USB ID addition stable trees
normally take.
