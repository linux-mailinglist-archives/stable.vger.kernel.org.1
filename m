Subject: mm/ksm: fix incorrect KSM counter handling in mm_struct during fork
Date: Wed, 24 Sep 2025 00:16:59 +0530

Patch series "mm/ksm: Fix incorrect accounting of KSM counters during
fork", v3.

The first patch in this series fixes the incorrect accounting of KSM
counters such as ksm_merging_pages, ksm_rmap_items, and the global
ksm_zero_pages during fork.

The following patch add a selftest to verify the ksm_merging_pages counter
was updated correctly during fork.

Test Results
============
Without the first patch
-----------------------
 # [RUN] test_fork_ksm_merging_page_count
 not ok 10 ksm_merging_page in child: 32

With the first patch
--------------------
 # [RUN] test_fork_ksm_merging_page_count
 ok 10 ksm_merging_pages is not inherited after fork


This patch (of 2):

Currently, the KSM-related counters in `mm_struct`, such as
`ksm_merging_pages`, `ksm_rmap_items`, and `ksm_zero_pages`, are inherited
by the child process during fork.  This results in inconsistent
accounting.

When a process uses KSM, identical pages are merged and an rmap item is
created for each merged page.  The `ksm_merging_pages` and
`ksm_rmap_items` counters are updated accordingly.  However, after a fork,
these counters are copied to the child while the corresponding rmap items
are not.  As a result, when the child later triggers an unmerge, there are
no rmap items present in the child, so the counters remain stale, leading
to incorrect accounting.

A similar issue exists with `ksm_zero_pages`, which maintains both a
global counter and a per-process counter.  During fork, the per-process
counter is inherited by the child, but the global counter is not
incremented.  Since the child also references zero pages, the global
counter should be updated as well.  Otherwise, during zero-page unmerge,
both the global and per-process counters are decremented, causing the
global counter to become inconsistent.

To fix this, ksm_merging_pages and ksm_rmap_items are reset to 0 during
fork, and the global ksm_zero_pages counter is updated with the
per-process ksm_zero_pages value inherited by the child.  This ensures
that KSM statistics remain accurate and reflect the activity of each
process correctly.
