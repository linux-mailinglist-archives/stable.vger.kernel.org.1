The problem with enumerating the PCI device which was already powered on is that
the pwrctrl driver cannot reliably know whether the device is powered on or not.
So by the time the pwrctrl driver probes, the client driver might also be
probing. For the case of WLAN chipsets, the pwrctrl driver used to sample the EN
(Enable) GPIO pin to know whether the device is powered on or not (see
a9aaf1ff88a8), but that also turned out to be racy and people were complaining.

So to simplify things, we enforced this dependency.

Pretty much so, but we will also use it to do D3Cold (during system suspend) in
the near future.

As I mentioned above, we cannot reliably detect whether a device is already
powered on or not from the pwrctrl driver when it probes. So because of that
reason, we enforce dependency and always reset/initialize the device to POR
state. If there is a reliable way
