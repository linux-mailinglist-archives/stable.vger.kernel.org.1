[ Upstream commit ad3e33fe071dffea07279f96dab4f3773c430fe2 ]

In commit 5f04e7ce392d ("drm/panel-edp: Split eDP panels out of
panel-simple") I moved a pile of panels out of panel-simple driver
into the newly created panel-edp driver. One of those panels, however,
shouldn't have been moved.

As is clear from commit e35e305eff0f ("drm/panel: simple: Add AUO
B116XW03 panel support"), AUX B116XW03 is an LVDS panel. It's used in
exynos5250-snow and exynos5420-peach-pit where it's clear that the
panel is hooked up with LVDS. Furthermore, searching for datasheets I
found one that makes it clear that this panel is LVDS.

As far as I can tell, I got confused because in commit 88d3457ceb82
("drm/panel: auo,b116xw03: fix flash backlight when power on") Jitao
Shi added "DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_eDP". That seems wrong. Looking at the
downstream ChromeOS trees, it seems like some Mediatek boards are
using a panel that they call "auo,b116xw03" that's an eDP panel. The
best I can guess is that they actually have a different panel that has
similar timing. If so then the proper panel should be used or they
should switch to the generic "edp-panel" compatible.

When moving this back to panel-edp, I wasn't sure what to use for
.bus_flags and .bus_format and whether to add the extra "enable" delay
from commit 88d3457ceb82 ("drm/panel: auo,b116xw03: fix flash
backlight when power on"). I've added formats/flags/delays based on my
(inexpert) analysis of the datasheet. These are untested.

NOTE: if/when this is backported to stable, we might run into some
trouble. Specifically, before 474c162878ba ("arm64: dts: mt8183:
jacuzzi: Move panel under aux-bus") this panel was used by
"mt8183-kukui-jacuzzi", which assumed it was an eDP panel. I don't
know what to suggest for that other than someone making up a bogus
panel for jacuzzi that's just for the stable channel.
