[ Upstream commit 40f2b11c1b7c593bbbfbf6bf333228ee53ed4050 ]

For a fsync we never reserve space in advance, we just start a transaction
without reserving space and we use an empty block reserve for a log tree.
We reserve space as we need while updating a log tree, we end up in
btrfs_use_block_rsv() when reserving space for the allocation of a log
tree extent buffer and we attempt first to reserve without flushing,
and if that fails we attempt to consume from the global reserve or
overcommit metadata. This makes us consume space that may be the last
resort for a transaction commit to succeed, therefore increasing the
chances for a transaction abort with -ENOSPC.

So make btrfs_use_block_rsv() fail if we can't reserve metadata space for
a log tree extent buffer allocation without flushing, making the fsync
fallback to a transaction commit and avoid using critical space that could
be the only resort for a transaction commit to succeed when we are in a
critical space situation.

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

### Step 1.1: Subject Line
- **Subsystem**: `btrfs` (filesystem)
- **Action verb**: "don't allow" — preventing unwanted behavior,
  indicating a correctness fix
- **Summary**: Prevent log trees from consuming the global reserve or
  overcommitting metadata space

### Step 1.2: Tags
- **Reviewed-by**: Leo Martins `<loemra.dev@gmail.com>` — reviewed
- **Signed-off-by**: Filipe Manana `<fdmanana@suse.com>` — author, core
  btrfs developer (1903 commits)
- **Signed-off-by**: David Sterba `<dsterba@suse.com>` — btrfs
  maintainer
- No Fixes: tag — expected for AUTOSEL candidates. The bug is a design
  oversight, not from a single commit.
- No Reported-by: tag — author identified the issue through code
  analysis
- No Cc: stable — expected for AUTOSEL candidates

### Step 1.3: Commit Body Analysis
The message clearly describes:
- **Bug mechanism**: During fsync, log trees don't reserve space in
  advance. When `btrfs_use_block_rsv()` can't reserve with NO_FLUSH, it
  falls through to consuming the global reserve or overcommitting
  metadata.
- **Symptom**: This depletes critical space needed for transaction
  commits to succeed, increasing the chances of transaction abort with
  -ENOSPC.
- **Failure mode**: Transaction abort with -ENOSPC makes the filesystem
  read-only.
- **Fix approach**: Fail immediately for log trees after NO_FLUSH
  attempt, forcing fsync to fall back to a full transaction commit.

### Step 1.4: Hidden Bug Fix Detection
This is NOT a hidden fix — it's explicitly described as preventing a
problematic behavior that leads to transaction aborts. Record: This is a
clear bug fix for ENOSPC transaction aborts.

---

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

### Step 2.1: Inventory
- **Files changed**: `fs/btrfs/block-rsv.c` only (single file)
- **Lines added**: ~25 (of which 2 are code, rest are extensive
  comments)
- **Lines removed**: 0
- **Function modified**: `btrfs_use_block_rsv()` — a single function
- **Scope**: Single-file surgical fix

### Step 2.2: Code Flow Change
The change inserts an early return AFTER the `BTRFS_RESERVE_NO_FLUSH`
attempt fails (line ~543) and BEFORE:
1. The global reserve fallback (lines 549-553)
2. The `BTRFS_RESERVE_FLUSH_EMERGENCY` overcommit (lines 562-565)

**Before**: Log tree allocations could steal from the global reserve and
use emergency flush.
**After**: Log tree allocations fail immediately, causing fsync to fall
back to a full transaction commit.

### Step 2.3: Bug Mechanism
This is a **logic/correctness fix**: Log trees are an optimization path
(fsync via log replay vs full commit). When they consume the global
reserve or use emergency flush, they deplete resources needed for
regular transaction commits, creating conditions for -ENOSPC transaction
aborts.

### Step 2.4: Fix Quality
- **Obviously correct**: YES — the 2-line check is trivial: `if
  (btrfs_root_id(root) == BTRFS_TREE_LOG_OBJECTID) return ERR_PTR(ret);`
- **Minimal/surgical**: YES — only 2 lines of actual code
- **Regression risk**: ZERO — the worst case is fsync falls back to a
  full transaction commit (slower but safe and already well-tested). All
  callers in `tree-log.c` handle this via `btrfs_set_log_full_commit()`.
- **Red flags**: None

---

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

### Step 3.1: Blame
The `try_reserve` section was originally by Josef Bacik (commit
`67f9c2209e885c`, 2019). The emergency flush was added by Josef Bacik in
commit `765c3fe99bcda0` (Sept 2022, ~v6.1). The bug has existed since
the original code and was worsened by the emergency flush addition.

### Step 3.2: Fixes Tag
No Fixes tag. This is a design oversight that goes back to when the
function was first written. The global reserve stealing has been
possible since the original `btrfs_use_block_rsv()`, and the emergency
flush (added in v6.1 timeframe) made it worse.

### Step 3.3: File History
Recent changes to `block-rsv.c` are mostly refactoring (removing fs_info
arguments, adding treelog_rsv, etc.). No other fix for this specific
issue exists.

### Step 3.4: Author
Filipe Manana is one of the top 3 btrfs contributors with 1903 commits.
He is a core developer and deeply familiar with ENOSPC handling. He also
wrote related fixes like commit `09e44868f1e03` ("btrfs: do not abort
transaction on failure to update log root"), which follows the same
principle: log tree failures should gracefully fall back, not abort
transactions.

### Step 3.5: Dependencies
- `btrfs_root_id()` was introduced in commit `e094f48040cda` (April
  2024, v6.12). For older stable trees, this would need to be
  `root->root_key.objectid`.
- No other structural dependencies — the check is independent of
  `treelog_rsv`.

---

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST RESEARCH

### Step 4.1-4.5
Lore.kernel.org was inaccessible due to bot protection. The commit was
submitted by Filipe Manana, signed by the btrfs maintainer David Sterba,
and reviewed by Leo Martins. The emergency flush commit message
(765c3fe99bcda0) mentions "100-200 ENOSPC aborts per day" at Facebook,
demonstrating the real-world impact of ENOSPC issues.

---

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

### Step 5.1: Key Functions
Modified function: `btrfs_use_block_rsv()`

### Step 5.2: Callers
`btrfs_use_block_rsv()` is called from `btrfs_alloc_tree_block()` in
`extent-tree.c` (line 5367). This is the central tree block allocation
function used by ALL btree operations including log tree operations.

### Step 5.3-5.4: Call Chain
For log trees: `btrfs_sync_log()` →
`btrfs_search_slot()`/`btrfs_cow_block()` → `btrfs_alloc_tree_block()` →
`btrfs_use_block_rsv()`. Errors propagate back, and `btrfs_sync_log()`
calls `btrfs_set_log_full_commit()` to fall back to full transaction
commit. This path is reachable from any `fsync()` syscall — a very
common user operation.

### Step 5.5: Similar Patterns
The pattern of checking root type before allowing dangerous operations
is used elsewhere in btrfs (e.g., `btrfs_init_root_block_rsv()` already
distinguishes log trees from other roots).

---

## PHASE 6: STABLE TREE ANALYSIS

### Step 6.1: Buggy Code in Stable Trees
The `btrfs_use_block_rsv()` function exists in ALL active stable trees.
The global reserve stealing has been there since the function was
written. Emergency flush was added in ~v6.1. Both paths allow log trees
to deplete critical reserves.

### Step 6.2: Backport Complications
- For 7.0.y: should apply cleanly
- For 6.12.y, 6.6.y: minor adjustment needed — `btrfs_root_id()` doesn't
  exist in 6.6; needs `root->root_key.objectid`
- For 6.1.y: same `btrfs_root_id` issue +
  `btrfs_reserve_metadata_bytes()` has `fs_info` parameter
- The function structure is preserved across all stable trees

### Step 6.3: No related fixes already in stable for this issue.

---

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM CONTEXT

### Step 7.1: Subsystem Criticality
**btrfs** (`fs/btrfs/`) — **CORE/IMPORTANT**. Btrfs is a major Linux
filesystem used widely, especially in enterprise (SUSE, Facebook/Meta),
NAS devices, and desktop Linux.

### Step 7.2: Activity
btrfs is actively developed with regular fixes. Filipe Manana alone has
many ENOSPC-related fixes.

---

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

### Step 8.1: Affected Users
All btrfs users who use `fsync()` under near-full filesystem conditions.
This is common for database workloads, log-heavy applications, and any
system with significant write activity.

### Step 8.2: Trigger Conditions
- Filesystem must be near-full or under metadata pressure
- Application calls `fsync()` which triggers log tree updates
- The NO_FLUSH reservation fails, and the log tree consumes the global
  reserve
- Subsequently, a real transaction commit fails because the global
  reserve is depleted
- Not timing-dependent — purely resource-based

### Step 8.3: Failure Mode Severity
**CRITICAL**: Transaction abort with -ENOSPC forces the filesystem read-
only. This is a data availability issue (filesystem becomes unusable
until remounted). The emergency flush commit message confirms "100-200
ENOSPC aborts per day" at scale at Facebook.

### Step 8.4: Risk-Benefit Ratio
- **Benefit**: VERY HIGH — prevents transaction aborts that make
  filesystem read-only
- **Risk**: VERY LOW — 2 lines of code, the fallback (full commit) is
  well-tested, zero regression potential
- **Ratio**: Overwhelmingly favorable

---

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

### Step 9.1: Evidence
**FOR backporting:**
- Prevents CRITICAL failure (ENOSPC transaction abort → filesystem goes
  read-only)
- Extremely small and surgical fix (2 lines of code)
- Obviously correct — log trees are an optimization that always has a
  safe fallback
- Written by core btrfs developer (Filipe Manana, 1903 commits)
- Reviewed and signed off by btrfs maintainer (David Sterba)
- Bug exists in all stable trees
- Zero regression risk — worst case is slightly slower fsync
- Well-established error handling path (`btrfs_set_log_full_commit()`)
- Emergency flush commit explicitly called out real-world ENOSPC aborts
  at scale

**AGAINST backporting:**
- No explicit Cc: stable (expected for AUTOSEL)
- No Fixes: tag (design oversight, not single-commit introduction)
- Minor adaptation needed for older stable trees (`btrfs_root_id` →
  `root->root_key.objectid`)

### Step 9.2: Stable Rules Checklist
1. **Obviously correct and tested?** YES — 2-line check, well-understood
   semantics
2. **Fixes a real bug?** YES — prevents ENOSPC transaction aborts
3. **Important issue?** YES — CRITICAL (filesystem goes read-only)
4. **Small and contained?** YES — single function, single file, 2 lines
   of code
5. **No new features or APIs?** CORRECT — no new features
6. **Can apply to stable?** YES (7.0 cleanly; older trees need trivial
   adaptation)

### Step 9.3: Exception Categories
Not applicable — this is a standard bug fix, not an exception category.

### Step 9.4: Decision
The evidence overwhelmingly supports backporting. This is a small,
obviously correct fix from a core btrfs developer that prevents a
critical failure mode (filesystem forced read-only by ENOSPC transaction
abort). The fix has zero regression risk because the fallback (full
transaction commit instead of log-based fsync) is a well-established
code path.
