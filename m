6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Tomi Valkeinen <tomi.valkeinen@ideasonboard.com>

commit c1ef9a6cabb34dbc09e31417b0c0a672fe0de13a upstream.

This reverts commit c9b1150a68d9362a0827609fc0dc1664c0d8bfe1.

Changing the enable/disable sequence has caused regressions on multiple
platforms: R-Car, MCDE, Rockchip. A series (see link below)  was sent to
fix these, but it was decided that it's better to revert the original
patch and change the enable/disable sequence only in the tidss driver.

Reverting this commit breaks tidss's DSI and OLDI outputs, which will be
fixed in the following commits.
