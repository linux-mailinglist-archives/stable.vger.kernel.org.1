Wow!

Sasha I think an impersonator has gotten into your account, and is
just making nonsense up.

This reads like an impassioned plea to backport this change, from
someone who has actually dealt with it.

However reading the justification in detail is an exercise in reading
falehoods.

If this does not come from an impersonator then if this comes
from a human being, I recommend you have a talk with them.

If this comes from a machine I recommend take it out of commission
and rework it.

If I see this kind of baloney again I expect I will just auto-nack
it instead of reading it, as reading it appears to be a waste of
time.  It is a complete waste reading fiction in what little time I have
for kernel development.

The links in the first paragraph are very distorted.  The links
from the actual change are:

 https://github.com/ROCm/ROCK-Kernel-Driver/issues/174
 https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2362

Those completely distorted links make understanding this justification
much harder then necessary.

That is a justification.   There is no evidence that a kernel change
made this worse.  Thus there is no evidence this is a regression fix.

Completely wrong.

This is a fundamental change to a susbsystem that the subsystem
maintainer does not say is low risk.

The change is a large change in the logic.

It obviously changes the behavior.  It is not at all obvious
the change is behavior is desirable for all callbacks, and in all
other scenarios.

Yes it has Tested-by tags.

Which commits that were backported?

Timing???  There is no race condition.

What evidence is there that this commit has been tested let alone
well-tested.

The entire line of reasoning is completely suspect.
