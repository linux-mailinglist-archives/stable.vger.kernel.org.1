I don't think so, even if on LoongArch, hibernation and various RANDOM
infra can co-exist (need some adjustment). Even if hibernation cannot
be used together with kASLR, we don't disable it at build time but at
run time. This means we can choose hibernation or kASLR with a single
kernel image.

I don't think this patch is an ugly hack, it is a proper adjustment.
Random kmalloc can still work with hibernation, delaying the seed
initialization only makes that random kmalloc doesn't work (fallback
to predictable kmalloc) for a very short time during the boot phase.
And again, kASLR is disable at run time rather than build time.

SLAB means "objects with the same type", right? So it is probably the
case. Yes, there is a very very low possibility that not the case,
but...

In theory x86_64 also has a low possibility that the idle task's stack
or other metadata be overwritten, then should we also disable random
kmalloc for x86_64?

On the other hand, if we really need to handle this theoretic
possibility about SLAB_FREELIST_RANDOM now, we can simply move
init_freelist_randomization() after all initcalls, too.
