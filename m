Yes, this seems like a reasonable approach though I understand all this=20
code is old, overly complicated, and when proposed changes are=20
available, little to no proper testing is done before it's commited and=20
it takes a very long time to get properly fixed.

I only bring this all up as the Linux AX.25 community has been badly=20
bitten by similar commits in the last few years.  I've tried to help=20
find a new maintainer and/or find somewhere to possibly create and run=20
CI tests to catch issues but I've been unsuccessful so far.

I am happy to try helping on the testing side once I know what the test=20
harness is but I'm out of my league when it comes to the code side.
