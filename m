From: Kirill A. Shutemov <kirill.shutemov@linux.intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 50e782a86c980d4f8292ef82ed8139282ca07a98 ]

Michael reported soft lockups on a system that has unaccepted memory.
This occurs when a user attempts to allocate and accept memory on
multiple CPUs simultaneously.

The root cause of the issue is that memory acceptance is serialized with
a spinlock, allowing only one CPU to accept memory at a time. The other
CPUs spin and wait for their turn, leading to starvation and soft lockup
reports.

To address this, the code has been modified to release the spinlock
while accepting memory. This allows for parallel memory acceptance on
multiple CPUs.

A newly introduced "accepting_list" keeps track of which memory is
currently being accepted. This is necessary to prevent parallel
acceptance of the same memory block. If a collision occurs, the lock is
released and the process is retried.

Such collisions should rarely occur. The main path for memory acceptance
is the page allocator, which accepts memory in MAX_ORDER chunks. As long
as MAX_ORDER is equal to or larger than the unit_size, collisions will
never occur because the caller fully owns the memory block being
accepted.

Aside from the page allocator, only memblock and deferered_free_range()
accept memory, but this only happens during boot.

The code has been tested with unit_size == 128MiB to trigger collisions
and validate the retry codepath.
