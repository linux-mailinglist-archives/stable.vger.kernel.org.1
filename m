Sorry for the confusion, let me clarify:

The original issue I reported to you on IRC was *without* a 
dock/external display attached, only a PD adapter was attached. With 
your patch, I no longer see these drm hotplug events in this scenario.

After confirming that your patch resolved the spurious hotplug events 
when using a PD charger, I connected a dock+external display to see if 
the patch caused any regressions there for me. It was here that I 
noticed a periodic hotplug event firing 2 times every 30 seconds was 
still showing up. I don't know if this is expected or not, I've never 
noticed it before because I wasn't monitoring udev events.

With PD charger only: no more spurious hotplug events firing

With dock+external displauy: 2x hotplug events every 30s.

The flickering was only on the internal display, and your patch here 
seems to have resolved that.
