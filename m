Not sure to understand what you need.


In torvalds/linux.git/ :
======================

My initial patch is with the same commit id:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-nomadik.c?id=05f933d5f7318b03ff2028c1704dc867ac16f2c7

The patch that cause the merge issue with older trees is this one. The 
patch above depends on it:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-nomadik.c?id=9c7174db4cdd111e10d19eed5c36fd978a14c8a2

The patch in Fixes:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-nomadik.c?id=235602146ec9c1882edf1ccc68389c1176be8198


In stable/linux.git/ :
====================

My initial patch is with the same commit id:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-nomadik.c?id=05f933d5f7318b03ff2028c1704dc867ac16f2c7

The patch in Fixes:

In stable/linux.git/?h=linux-6.4.y :
==================================

My patch and the one it depends one are available there, obviously.

The patch in Fixes:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-nomadik.c?h=linux-6.4.y&id=235602146ec9c1882edf1ccc68389c1176be8198


The patch sent as "[PATCH 6.4.y] i2c: busses: i2c-nomadik:..." is commit 
05f933d5f731 + a need part of 9c7174db4cdd.

If 9c7174db4cdd is backported as well (and applies cleanly), 
05f933d5f731 should also work un-modified.
