I guess you might have written this before reading the entire email as
the WARN_ON_ONCE() I suggested would have caught the caller side bug(s).

The ath11k assumes res was setup by of_reserved_mem_region_to_resource()=20
that appearently wasn't the case (a logic bug introduced in the commit=20
900730dc4705 ("wifi: ath: Use of_reserved_mem_region_to_resource() for=20
"memory-region""), and then calls resource_size() without first making=20
sure the resource is valid.

There are at least two, if not three, problems on the caller side here.=20

git grep -e '->end =3D .* - 1'

A more complex pattern or Coccinelle can find more for you if you want to=
=20
find multiline or other more complex constructs.

Those mostly predate the init helpers (I did have a series to convert them=
=20
to resource_set_range() but DEFINE_RES() got introduced in the meantime=20
too so I'd have needed to adapt many of the changes so I left the series=20
to rotten as it was always a cleanup side-project to me and I've more=20
on my plate than I've time for currently even in the main resource=20
assignment algorithm).

As noted below, DEFINE_RES*(), resource_set_range() and=20
resource_set_size() in include/linux/ioport.h are your friends here.
In general, DEFINE_RES is preferred but when only addresses of a resource=
=20
are adjusted dynamically, those C functions are better suited for the=20
task.

Yes but it is a latent logic bug (using the resource size as the proxy=20
for proper validity check in the logic).

Using these proxies (in general) is what makes it hard to make some=20
resource change I'd actually want to do in the PCI core so I don't have=20
have much love for it (I'll probably eventually have to audit them all=20
myself :-(). As a result, we currently have the unfortunate situation that=
=20
a resizable BAR that cannot be initially assigned is lost forever. The=20
resource had to be reset on assignment failure to keep these proxies=20
agreeing with the state of the resource, as endpoint drivers would be=20
confused otherwise, so making space by resizing other BARs will not bring=
=20
the other BAR back.

This proxy problem actually extends beyond mere resource_size(). There are=
=20
also start and end address checks and pci_resource_len() checks similarly=
=20
used as proxies. None of those proxies remain valid if PCI core stops to=20
reset resource addresses and flags.

Unfortunately I'm no OF expert but at least drivers/of/ didn't have=20
anything interesting when grepping with:

git grep -e '->end =3D ' -e '\.end =3D ' -- drivers/of

Yes please to fixing ath11k!

And if you're fine with dealing all the reports that will get directed to=
=20
you because of adding that WARN_ON_ONCE() into resource_size() I'd be very=
=20
happy of having to not do it myself eventually but please do realize it
may be more than a few reports over a few next kernel releases. ;-)

That being said, I just tested on one machine here and it seems to not=20
fire even once so we could get more lucky than I was assuming.

It might also be helpful to add kernel doc to resource_size() and mention=
=20
it should not be used as a proxy for other things as we've discussed here.


On contrary to what I said earlier, I just realized the series adding
resource_assigned() got accepted [1] in this cycle so it's now available=20
in Linus' tree.
