[ Upstream commit dc4b4d04e1caa3552f000d84d832779ebe51b093 ]

Steve reported an eGPU (either Radeon Instinct MI50 32GB or NVIDIA 3080
10GB) connected via Thunderbolt was not assigned sufficient BAR space in
v6.11, so the amdgpu and nvidia drivers were unable to initialize the
device.

pci_bridge_distribute_available_resources() -> ... ->
adjust_bridge_window() is called between __pci_bus_size_bridges()
and assigning the resources. Since the commit 948675736a77 ("PCI: Allow
adjust_bridge_window() to shrink resource if necessary")
adjust_bridge_window() can also shrink the bridge window.  The shrunken
size, however, conflicts with what __pci_bus_size_bridges() ->
pbus_size_mem() calculated as the required bridge window size. By shrinking
the size, adjust_bridge_window() prevents the rest of the resource fitting
algorithm from working as intended.  Resource fitting logic is expecting
assignment failures when bridge windows need resizing, but there are cases
where failures are no longer happening after the commit 948675736a77 ("PCI:
Allow adjust_bridge_window() to shrink resource if necessary").

The commit 948675736a77 ("PCI: Allow adjust_bridge_window() to shrink
resource if necessary") justifies the change by the extra reservation
made due to hpmemsize parameter, however, the kernel code contradicts
that statement. (For simplicity, finer-grained hpmmiosize and hpmmiopref
parameters that can be used to the same effect as hpmemsize are ignored in
this description.)

pbus_size_mem() calls calculate_memsize() twice. First with add_size=0
to find out the minimal required resource size. The second call occurs
with add_size=hpmemsize (effectively) but the result does not directly
affect the resource size only resulting in an entry on the realloc_head
list (a.k.a. add_list). Yet, adjust_bridge_window() directly changes
the resource size which does not include what is reserved due to
hpmemsize. Also, if the required size for the bridge window exceeds
hpmemsize, the parameter does not have any effect even on the second
size calculation made by pbus_size_mem(); from calculate_memsize():

  size = max(size, add_size) + children_add_size;

The commit ae4611f1d7e9 ("PCI: Set resource size directly in
adjust_bridge_window()") that precedes the commit 948675736a77 ("PCI:
Allow adjust_bridge_window() to shrink resource if necessary") is also
related to causing this problem. Its changelog explicitly states
adjust_bridge_window() wants to "guarantee" allocation success.
Guaranteed allocations, however, are incompatible with how the other
parts of the resource fitting algorithm work. The given justification
fails to explain why guaranteed allocations at this stage are required
nor why forcing window to a smaller value than what was calculated by
pbus_size_mem() is correct. While the change might have worked by chance
in some test scenario, too small bridge window does not "guarantee"
success from the point of view of the endpoint device resource
assignments. No issue is mentioned within the changelog so it's unclear
if the change was made to fix some observed issue nor and what that
issue was.

The unwanted shrinking of a bridge window occurs, e.g., when a device with
large BARs such as eGPU is attached using Thunderbolt and the Root Port
holds less than enough resource space for the eGPU. The GPU resources are
in order of GBs and the default hotplug allocation is a mere 2MB
(DEFAULT_HOTPLUG_MMIO_PREF_SIZE). The problem is illustrated by this log
(filtered to the relevant content only):

  pci 0000:00:07.0: PCI bridge to [bus 03-2c]
  pci 0000:00:07.0:   bridge window [mem 0x6000000000-0x601bffffff 64bit pref]
  pci 0000:03:00.0: PCI bridge to [bus 00]
  pci 0000:03:00.0:   bridge window [mem 0x00000000-0x000fffff 64bit pref]
  pci 0000:03:00.0: bridge configuration invalid ([bus 00-00]), reconfiguring
  pci 0000:03:00.0: PCI bridge to [bus 04-2c]

  pci 0000:03:00.0: bridge window [mem 0x800000000-0x10003fffff 64bit pref] to [bus 04-2c] add_size 100000 add_align 100000
  pcieport 0000:00:07.0: distributing available resources
  pci 0000:03:00.0: bridge window [mem 0x800000000-0x10003fffff 64bit pref] shrunken by 0x00000007e4400000
  pci 0000:03:00.0: bridge window [mem 0x6000000000-0x601bffffff 64bit pref]: assigned

The initial size of the Root Port's window is 448MB (0x601bffffff -
0x6000000000). __pci_bus_size_bridges() -> pbus_size_mem() calculates the
required size to be 32772 MB (0x10003fffff - 0x800000000) which would fit
the eGPU resources. adjust_bridge_window() then shrinks the bridge window
down to what is guaranteed to fit into the Root Port's bridge window. The
bridge window for 03:00.0 is also eliminated from the add_list (a.k.a.
realloc_head) list by adjust_bridge_window().

After adjustment, the resources are assigned and as the bridge window for
03:00.0 is assigned successfully, no failure is recorded. Without a
failure, no attempt to resize the window of the Root Port is required.  The
end result is eGPU not having large enough resources to work.

The commit 948675736a77 ("PCI: Allow adjust_bridge_window() to shrink
resource if necessary") also claims nested bridge windows are sized the
same, which is false. pbus_size_mem() calculates the size for the parent
bridge window by summing all the downstream resources so the resource
fitting calculates larger bridge window for the parent to accommodate the
childen. That is, hpmemsize does not result the same size for the case
where there are nested bridge windows.

In order to fix the most immediate problem, don't shrink the resource size
in adjust_bridge_window() as hpmemsize had nothing to do with it.  When
considering add_size, only reduce it up to what is added due to hpmemsize
(if required size is larger than hpmemsize, the parameter has no impact,
see calculate_memsize()). Unfortunately, if the tail of the bridge window
was aligned in calculate_memsize() from below hpmemsize to above it, the
size check will falsely match but the check at least errs to the side of
caution. There's not enough information available in adjust_bridge_window()
to know the calculated size precisely.

This is not exactly a revert of the commits e4611f1d7e9 ("PCI: Set resource
size directly in adjust_bridge_window()") and 948675736a77 ("PCI: Allow
adjust_bridge_window() to shrink resource if necessary") as shrinking still
remains in place but is implemented differently, and the end result behaves
very differently.

It is possible that those two commits fixed some other issue that is not
described with enough detail in the changelog and undoing parts of them
results in another regression due to behavioral change.  Nonetheless, as
described above, the solution by those two commits was flawed and the
issue, if one exists, should be solved in a way that is compatible with the
rest of the resource fitting algorithm instead of working against it.

Besides shrinking, the case where adjust_bridge_window() expands the bridge
window is likely somewhat wrong as well because it removes the entry from
add_list (a.k.a. realloc_head), but it is less damaging as that only
impacts optional resources and may have no impact if expanding by hpmemsize
is larger than what add_size was. Fixing it is left as further work.
