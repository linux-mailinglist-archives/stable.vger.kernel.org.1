[ Upstream commit 54f1f020e9f4a087779cc4d96a7c86f47d0c6797 ]

If retries are exhausted, driver should not do futher operation.
During mt79xx firmware download process, if the retry count reaches0,
driver will return an -EIO error and release the firmware resources.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Now I have all the information needed for a thorough analysis. Let me
compile the full assessment.

---

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: Subject Line**
Record: [bluetooth/btmtk] [improve] Fix retry exhaustion handling in
mt79xx firmware setup - when retry count reaches 0, driver should return
error instead of continuing.

**Step 1.2: Tags**
- Signed-off-by: Chris Lu <chris.lu@mediatek.com> (author, regular
  MediaTek Bluetooth contributor)
- Signed-off-by: Luiz Augusto von Dentz <luiz.von.dentz@intel.com>
  (Bluetooth maintainer, committed the patch)
- No Fixes: tag, no Reported-by, no Cc: stable - expected for manual
  review candidates.

**Step 1.3: Commit Body**
The body describes: "If retries are exhausted, driver should not do
further operation. During mt79xx firmware download process, if the retry
count reaches 0, driver will return an -EIO error and release the
firmware resources." Clear description of a missing error check.

**Step 1.4: Hidden Bug Fix Detection**
Despite the word "improve" in the subject, this IS a bug fix. The word
"improve" masks a clear logic error: the retry loop can exhaust without
any error return, causing the driver to silently proceed with firmware
download on a device in an abnormal state.

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

**Step 2.1: Inventory**
- 1 file changed: `drivers/bluetooth/btmtk.c`
- +6 lines added (1 comment, 5 code lines)
- Function modified: `btmtk_setup_firmware_79xx()`
- Scope: single-file surgical fix

**Step 2.2: Code Flow Change**
The retry loop at line 171 (`while (retry > 0)`) handles
`BTMTK_WMT_PATCH_PROGRESS` by decrementing `retry`. BEFORE: if retry
hits 0, the loop exits normally and code falls through to `fw_ptr +=
section_offset`, proceeding with firmware download. AFTER: a check for
`retry == 0` returns `-EIO` and jumps to `err_release_fw`.

**Step 2.3: Bug Mechanism**
This is a **logic/correctness fix** - missing error check after retry
exhaustion. The `while (retry > 0)` loop can exit via:
1. `break` when status == `BTMTK_WMT_PATCH_UNDONE` (normal path -
   proceed to download)
2. `goto next_section` when status == `BTMTK_WMT_PATCH_DONE` (skip
   section)
3. `goto err_release_fw` on command error or unexpected status
4. Loop exhaustion when retry reaches 0 (BUG: falls through to download
   path)

Case 4 is the bug - the code proceeds as if the device is ready when
it's not.

**Step 2.4: Fix Quality**
Obviously correct. The check `if (retry == 0)` can only be true if the
loop exhausted, meaning the device never left `PATCH_PROGRESS` state.
Returning `-EIO` and cleaning up is the correct behavior. No regression
risk.

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

**Step 3.1: Blame**
The buggy code was introduced in commit `8c0d17b6b06c5b` "Bluetooth:
mediatek: add BT_MTK module" by Sean Wang on 2021-10-19. This was the
initial creation of the BT_MTK module.

**Step 3.2: No Fixes: tag** - expected.

**Step 3.3: File History**
The function `btmtk_setup_firmware_79xx` has been stable since 2021 in
the retry loop area. The surrounding code has only had one minor change
(commit `995d948cf2e458` adding `err = -EIO` in the else branch).

**Step 3.4: Author**
Chris Lu is a regular MediaTek Bluetooth contributor with 28+ commits
touching `drivers/bluetooth/`, including many device ID additions and
critical fixes.

**Step 3.5: Dependencies**
This commit is patch 1/3 of a series, but it is **standalone**. Patches
2/3 and 3/3 add additional improvements (status checking and reset
mechanism) that build on this but are not required. The fix applies
cleanly without dependencies.

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST RESEARCH

**Step 4.1: Original Discussion**
Found via `b4 dig -c 54f1f020e9f4`: Submitted as `[PATCH v1 1/3]` on
2026-02-03. The cover letter explains: "When the device unexpectedly
restarts during previous firmware download process, it can cause mt79xx
firmware status to be abnormal in the next attempt." Series applied to
bluetooth-next by Luiz Augusto von Dentz on 2026-04-10.

**Step 4.2: Review**
Only v1 was submitted (no revisions needed). The Bluetooth maintainer
(Luiz Augusto von Dentz) applied the series directly, indicating
confidence in the fix quality.

**Step 4.3: Bug Report**
No specific bug report link. The cover letter describes a real-world
scenario where the device unexpectedly restarts during firmware
download.

**Step 4.4: Series Context**
Part of 3-patch series, but this patch is standalone. Patches 2 and 3
are independent improvements that enhance the error recovery further.

**Step 4.5: Stable Discussion**
No existing stable nomination or discussion found.

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1: Key Function**
`btmtk_setup_firmware_79xx()` - firmware setup for MT79xx series.

**Step 5.2: Callers**
- `btmtk_usb_setup()` in `btmtk.c` line 1332 - USB path for MT7922,
  MT7925, MT7961
- `mt79xx_setup()` in `btmtksdio.c` line 873 - SDIO path

Both are called during device initialization/setup.

**Step 5.3-5.4: Reachability**
Called during HCI device setup, triggered when a MT79xx Bluetooth device
is initialized. This is a common code path for all MT792x Bluetooth
device users.

## PHASE 6: STABLE TREE ANALYSIS

**Step 6.1: Code exists in stable**
The buggy code was introduced in October 2021 (commit `8c0d17b6b06c5b`).
Tags show it's in p-6.1, p-6.6, and all newer stable trees. The bug
affects ALL active stable trees.

**Step 6.2: Backport Complexity**
The patch should apply cleanly - the retry loop code hasn't changed
since the original 2021 commit.

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM CONTEXT

**Step 7.1: Subsystem**
Bluetooth driver (drivers/bluetooth/) - IMPORTANT criticality.
MT7921/MT7922/MT7925 are extremely popular WiFi/BT combo chips found in
many laptops (Lenovo, ASUS, Dell, etc.).

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

**Step 8.1: Affected Users**
Users of MediaTek MT7921, MT7922, MT7925 Bluetooth devices (very large
population).

**Step 8.2: Trigger Conditions**
Triggered when the device reports `BTMTK_WMT_PATCH_PROGRESS`
continuously for 2+ seconds during firmware download. The cover letter
describes this happening after an unexpected device restart during a
previous firmware download attempt.

**Step 8.3: Failure Mode**
Without fix: firmware download proceeds on a device in an abnormal
state, potentially leading to device malfunction, failed bluetooth
initialization, or undefined behavior. Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH.

**Step 8.4: Risk-Benefit Ratio**
- BENEFIT: Prevents firmware download to a device in an abnormal state
  for widely-used hardware
- RISK: Extremely low - 5 lines, obviously correct, only affects an
  already-failed case
- Ratio: Strongly favorable

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Evidence FOR backporting:**
- Fixes a real logic error (missing error check after retry exhaustion)
- Very small and surgical (5 lines of code)
- Obviously correct
- Affects widely-used hardware (MT792x family)
- Standalone fix with no dependencies
- Applied by subsystem maintainer without revisions needed
- Buggy code exists in all active stable trees since 2021
- Clean apply expected

**Evidence AGAINST backporting:**
- Not a crash/panic fix - the immediate impact is proceeding with
  firmware download in an abnormal state
- No specific user-reported bug linked
- Commit message uses "improve" rather than "fix"

**Stable Rules Checklist:**
1. Obviously correct and tested? YES - trivially verifiable, applied to
   bluetooth-next
2. Fixes a real bug? YES - missing error handling after retry exhaustion
3. Important issue? MEDIUM-HIGH - prevents undefined device behavior
   during firmware setup for popular hardware
4. Small and contained? YES - 5 lines, one file, one function
5. No new features? CORRECT - pure error handling fix
6. Can apply to stable? YES - clean apply expected

  maintainer
- [Phase 4] Thread mbox: series was applied to bluetooth-next,
  patchwork-bot confirmed
- [Phase 4] Cover letter: describes real-world scenario (device restart
  during firmware download)
- [Phase 5] Grep callers: btmtk_usb_setup() (USB path) and
  mt79xx_setup() (SDIO path) both call this function
- [Phase 6] Code unchanged in retry loop since 2021 - clean apply
  expected
- [Phase 8] Failure mode: proceeds with firmware download on abnormal
  device state, severity MEDIUM-HIGH
