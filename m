5.4-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Yun Lu <luyun@kylinos.cn>

commit 55f0bfc0370539213202f4ce1a07615327ac4713 upstream.

When MSG_DONTWAIT is not set, the tpacket_snd operation will wait for
pending_refcnt to decrement to zero before returning. The pending_refcnt
is decremented by 1 when the skb->destructor function is called,
indicating that the skb has been successfully sent and needs to be
destroyed.

If an error occurs during this process, the tpacket_snd() function will
exit and return error, but pending_refcnt may not yet have decremented to
zero. Assuming the next send operation is executed immediately, but there
are no available frames to be sent in tx_ring (i.e., packet_current_frame
returns NULL), and skb is also NULL, the function will not execute
wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout() to yield the CPU. Instead, it
will enter a do-while loop, waiting for pending_refcnt to be zero. Even
if the previous skb has completed transmission, the skb->destructor
function can only be invoked in the ksoftirqd thread (assuming NAPI
threading is enabled). When both the ksoftirqd thread and the tpacket_snd
operation happen to run on the same CPU, and the CPU trapped in the
do-while loop without yielding, the ksoftirqd thread will not get
scheduled to run. As a result, pending_refcnt will never be reduced to
zero, and the do-while loop cannot exit, eventually leading to a CPU soft
lockup issue.

In fact, skb is true for all but the first iterations of that loop, and
as long as pending_refcnt is not zero, even if incremented by a previous
call, wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout() should be executed to
yield the CPU, allowing the ksoftirqd thread to be scheduled. Therefore,
the execution condition of this function should be modified to check if
pending_refcnt is not zero, instead of check skb.

-	if (need_wait && skb) {
+	if (need_wait && packet_read_pending(&po->tx_ring)) {

As a result, the judgment conditions are duplicated with the end code of
the while loop, and packet_read_pending() is a very expensive function.
Actually, this loop can only exit when ph is NULL, so the loop condition
can be changed to while (1), and in the "ph = NULL" branch, if the
subsequent condition of if is not met,  the loop can break directly. Now,
the loop logic remains the same as origin but is clearer and more obvious.
