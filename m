Do we know what the PCIe controller is here?  Is there a public
datasheet for it?

I've seen other issues that make me wonder if some controllers work
like this:

  - PCIe error occurs on read or write transaction

  - PCIe write dropped or read completed by the controller
    synthesizing ~0 data to CPU

  - PCIe controller signals Asynchronous SError as a result of the
    error

But I guess even if the above happens, I can't explain why the PCIe
error would occur in the first place.  Scott didn't mention anything
like an FLR.  But maybe if we actually got as far as programming
something bogus in a BAR, a read might get no response (or two
responses).

I would assume there should be something logged in the AER Capability,
but I don't think we've looked at that yet.  The AER interrupt is also
asynchronous, so not surprising that this panic could happen before
handling it.
