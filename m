I.e. this is a non-sustainable solution:

	if (vendor && product) {
		dev_info(&chip->dev,
			"Consider adding the following entry to tpm_tis_dmi_table:\n");
		dev_info(&chip->dev, "\tDMI_SYS_VENDOR: %s\n", vendor);
		dev_info(&chip->dev, "\tDMI_PRODUCT_VERSION: %s\n", product);
	}

This is also super time consuming and takes the focus away from more
important matters (like most likely the AMD rng fix would have gone
smoother without these getting in the way all the time).
