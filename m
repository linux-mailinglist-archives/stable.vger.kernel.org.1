Correct. (I assume the existing Rust kernel code contains no float or SIMD types 
so this is largely theoretical. But I'm a Rust compiler / upstream dev, not a 
Rust-for-Linux / kernel dev, so I might be entirely off here.)

Personally I think it would be a breaking change to start using neon in the 
aarch64-softfloat target, for reasons such as what we are discussing. (And this 
means we won't do it.) We have generally, but implicitly, understood "softfloat" 
to mean both "uses softfloat ABI" and "does not use any FP/SIMD registers by 
default". But I don't know whether the Rust compiler team has formally committed 
to anything here. I can inquire about that if you want.

OTOH I cannot see how adding "-neon" could possibly hurt, either. It's juts a 
NOP currently.

Kind regards,
Ralf
