6.1-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Ilya Dryomov <idryomov@gmail.com>

commit c10311776f0a8ddea2276df96e255625b07045a8 upstream.

Unlike header read-in, parent info read-in is already decoupled in
get_parent_info(), but it's buried in rbd_dev_v2_parent_info() along
with the processing logic.

Separate the initial read-in and update read-in logic into
rbd_dev_setup_parent() and rbd_dev_update_parent() respectively and
have rbd_dev_v2_parent_info() just populate struct parent_image_info
(i.e. what get_parent_info() did).  Some existing QoI issues, like
flatten of a standalone clone being disregarded on refresh, remain.
