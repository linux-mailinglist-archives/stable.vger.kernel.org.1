If you want my honest answer, I don't think fix + revert "cycles" really 
belong there but I'm not going to complain that much either, I understand 
managing / keeping track of all that is not so easy (and that scripts 
tend to be stupid).

Yes, it's important but my main worry here is it introduces latency and 
I've no knowledge if this kind of notes are enough to halt the stable 
release until the revert also makes into the stable-queue?

Okay, thanks for the clarification.
