Great, thanks.  Let's please incorporate this into the v2 changelogging.

"much safer and smaller" is very desirable for backporting, please. 
After all, 866898efbb25 didn't really fix anything and reverting that
takes us back to a known-to-work implementation.

I of course have no problem making the changes in this patchset for
"going forward"!

So if agreeable, please prepare a patch which reverts 866898efbb25. 
Robert's words above are a great basis for that patch's description.
