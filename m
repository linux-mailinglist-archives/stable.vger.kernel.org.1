That just proves my point though - if you disable ARM_SMMU_QCOM in that 
context then you've got a kernel which won't work properly on Qualcomm 
platforms, so you may as well have just disabled ARCH_QCOM anyway. In 
fact the latter is objectively better since it then would not break the 
fundamental premise of "a core kernel that works across all supported 
arch's" :/

Maybe if you can find a viable way to separate out all the arm-smmu-qcom 
stuff into its own sub-module which only loads when needed, or possibly 
make SCM a soft-dep (given that we already have to cope with it being 
loaded but not initialised yet) then that might be a reasonable change 
to make; as it stands, I don't think this patch is. And it's definitely 
not a stable "fix" either way.

But frankly, weird modules happen. Why the heck is parport_pc currently 
loaded on my AArch64 workstation!? I can't even begin to imagine, but 
I'll live...

Thanks,
Robin.
