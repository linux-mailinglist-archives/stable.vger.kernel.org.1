Sorry for confusion.

The internal state (test->irq_type) has the state IRQ_TYPE_UNDEFINED and
the global irq_type doesn't. Then I've thought that ioctl(GET_IRQTYPE)
should not return UNDEFINED state.

However, ioctl(GET_IRQTYPE) can return with an error if the state is
UNDEFINED. This is new behavior, but not inconsistent.
So the additional irq_type is no longer necessary.

I see.
I'll add new patch to remove the global irq_type and replace with
test->irq_type.

Yes, I've confirmed the conflict and I'll rebase it next.

Okay, I expect another topic after we remove the global variables.

As mentioned above, PCITEST_GET_IRQTYPE can fail with an error, and
I understand that this will not affect the test.
