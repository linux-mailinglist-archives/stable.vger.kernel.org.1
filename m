Hi MIchael,

Thanks for your patch!

That's the explanation for what this patch does.

The below is not directly related to that, so IMHO it does not
belong in the description of this patch.

We do not really have a way to record comments in git history
after the fact.  The best you can do is to reply to the email thread
where the patch was submitted.  When people follow the Link:
tag to the lore archive in the original commit, they can read any follow-ups.

I am confused.  So before, the partition size as seen by Linux after
the truncation, was correct?

But if Linux did see the correct size, mkfs would have used the correct
size, too, and the size in the recorded file system should be correct?

Hence there is no need to resize the file system, just to fix the
partition size in the RDB?

And this block number is supposed to be in the first 2 cylinders of
the disk, so it can never be equal or larger than 1 << 31, right?
We only really expect to see -1 here, not just any negative number.
So I think it would be safer to check against -1.
Or  against U32_MAX, to avoid the cast.
