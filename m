Subject: mm: page_alloc: free pages to correct buddy list after PCP lock contention
Date: Tue, 5 Sep 2023 10:09:22 +0100

Commit 4b23a68f9536 ("mm/page_alloc: protect PCP lists with a spinlock")
returns pages to the buddy list on PCP lock contention. However, for
migratetypes that are not MIGRATE_PCPTYPES, the migratetype may have
been clobbered already for pages that are not being isolated. In
practice, this means that CMA pages may be returned to the wrong
buddy list. While this might be harmless in some cases as it is
MIGRATE_MOVABLE, the pageblock could be reassigned in rmqueue_fallback
and prevent a future CMA allocation. Lookup the PCP migratetype
against unconditionally if the PCP lock is contended.
