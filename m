Please tell me how to do so.

Depends, I already put a huge latency on drm stable patches because of
this mess.  And I see few, if any, actual backports for when I report
FAILED stable patches, so what is going to get slower than it currently
is?

Yup.

Normally you all tag these cherry-picks as such.  You didn't do that
here or either place, so there was no way for anyone to know.  Please
fix that.

Intel trees have traditionally been the worst, but normally you all give
me some cherry-pick clue on the commits so I can weed them out.  That
didn't happen here.

But, I will note that the AMD drm tree is now starting to do this, in
much worse ways than the Intel tree because there is NO cherry-pick
information anywhere, so again, I have no idea what to do and massive
conflicts happen.

So AMD is copying your bad behavior, please, both of you stop and fix
this so that it isn't so broken.

Again, I understand the need/want to have multiple versions of the same
patch in different branches to get fixes merged quicker, but when you do
that, please give me a way to determine this, otherwise we have no
chance.

thanks,
