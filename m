Well, a (non-inline) directory where '.' is a single directory entry
that fills the file system block should (probably) never occur in
nature.  So from that perspective, the check that you propose is
probably fine.

HOWEVER.  The check that e2fsck does is slightly different, which is
stronger in some ways, and weaker than others relative to what you
propose.  What e2fsck checks for non-inline directory is that '.' must
be first entry, and '..' must be the second directory entry.

So if somehow, a file system gets created where '.' is the first entry
that fills the first directory block, and '..' is the second entry
which is at the beginning of the second directory block, we would be
in the interesting situation where it's possible that the kernel would
report the file system to be corrupted --- not in the case of
check_empty_dir() used in the rmdir_path, but there are other calls to
check_dir_entry that will result in the file system to be declare
corrupted --- then when the user runs e2fsck on a file system declared
corrupted by the kernel, e2fsck would return a Big Thumbs Up; but then
when the kernel trips over that directory again, it would get declared
corrupted again.

So this ultimately turns on the definition of "valid".  If the
definition is "could this happen naturally, at least using all Linux
implementations that I'm aware of", then no, it's not valid.  However,
if there is some other implementation of ext2/ext3/ext4 (say, BSD,
Hurd, etc.), or a potentially malicious user (or a fuzzer) carefully
crafts a file system, and e2fsck reports that the file system doesn't
have any problems, then yes there _could_ be valid file systems where
'.' is both the first and last directory entry.

Is it likely that there are other legitimate implementations that
would create such a file system?  No, it's highly unlikely.  So one
approach might be to make this change in what is officially considered
valid as defined by e2fsck.  The downside of this would be that there
could be a version skew, where the kernel change gets backported into
an LTS kernel, but the user doesn't upgrade to a newer version of
e2fsprogs, the user might get confused.

In this particular case, I think it's worthwhile to make the change,
since if we don't make the change in __ext4_check_dir_entry(), it's
not enough to make a change in ext4_empty_dir().  We'd have to audit
*all* of check_dir_entry's, and a quick check indicates we'd also need
to add a check to ext4_get_first_dir_block().

I'd change the check to:

	else if (unlikely(next_offset == size && de->name_len == 1 &&
			  strcmp(".", de->name) == 0))

which is a bit more optimized.

So if you resend this commit with this change, and remove the question
to the ext4 maintainers (for future reference, it's best to put things
that don't need to be in the commit if the patch gets accepted after
the '---' line and before the diffstat, since that way if the
maintainer is ready to accept the patch, they won't have the edit the
commit description), I'd be happy to accept the patch.

Also, the best way to test a commit is not just to run all of the
ext4/* xfstests patches, but to run a smoke test.  If you use
kvm-xfstests[1], you can do this via "kvm-xfstests smoke", which is
syntactic sugar for "SOAK_DURATION=3m check -g smoketest" and will
take 15-20 minutes.  If you want to spend a bit more time, you can run
the quick group ("check -g quick" or "kvm-xfstests -c ext4/4k -g
quick").

The reason why I mention using kvm-xfstests is because in the future,
if you try your hand at fixing a syzbot issue that uses a slightly
more exotic feature, such as inline_data, you'd want to do something
like "kvm-xfstests -c ext4/inline <test_specifiers>" so that the file
system is set up correctly for testing those code paths.  And of
course, for more testing fun, please see gce-xfstests[2].

Many thanks,

P.S.  If anyone is interested in adding support for other cloud
platforms such as Amazon and Azure as an additional back ends to
xfstests-bld -- we have support for MacOS's hvf, Docker and Android as
back ends, and more would be great; please contact me.  Patches
Gratefully Accepted.  :-)
