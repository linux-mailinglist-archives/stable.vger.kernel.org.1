I was trying to bring some order to this driver so that the receiver is
enabled when the port is opened and disabled when it is closed again as
expected, and get rid of the random calls added in places where they do
not belong (e.g., as Bjorn also mentioned, why was the call to start rx
added in the port setup code if it was needed for hibernation?).

Data "received" over the wire before opening the port should not be
processed, but it also turns out that enabling the receiver before the
port is opened can confuse the firmware and break the "stale" rx timer
handling so that data is only forwarded in chunks of 12 bytes instead of
when each char is received.

Ok, so the kgdb has started relying on this call since d8851a96ba25
("tty: serial: qcom-geni-serial: Add a poll_init() function"). Thanks
for pointing that out.

The polled console code should not be calling the port setup code
unconditionally anyway so I'll fix this up as well in v3.
