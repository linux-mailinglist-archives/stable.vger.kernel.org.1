Oh, thank you!  This inability of pwrctrl to determine the current
device power state is a critical missing piece in understanding the
race.

Although d8b762070c3f ("power: sequencing: qcom-wcn: set the
wlan-enable GPIO to output") suggests that gpiod_get_value_cansleep()
*does* read the current GPIO state, i.e., the current device power
state.

29da3e8748f9 ("power: sequencing: qcom-wcn: explain why we need the
WLAN_EN GPIO hack") adds a comment that we *should* use GPIOD_OUT_LOW
(which would toggle WLAN power) but can't until the qcom controller
driver implements link-down handling.

Is power-cycling the PCI device when pwrctrl loads a requirement of
the pwrctrl design?  A power cycle adds significant latency, so it
seems a little aggressive to me unless it is absolutely required.

29da3e8748f9 also mentions some platforms that still fail to probe
WLAN due to some unspecified qcom issue that needs a workaround, so I
guess this is still an open issue?

So I wonder if this inability to determine the current power state is
real or just an artifact of the various workarounds so far.

Turning main power on and off is exactly what D3cold is about.  I
expected this kind of use for suspend, which is why I asked about
overlap with ACPI, which also provides ways to control main power.
