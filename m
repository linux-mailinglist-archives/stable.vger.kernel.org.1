The ~0 response is not required by the PCIe spec, although there's at
least one implementation note to the effect that a Root Complex
intended for use with software that depends on ~0 data when a config
request fails with Unsupported Request must synthesize that value
(this one is from PCIe r7.0, sec 2.3.2).

Perfect, thanks, I'll watch for this.
