Hum, so in all the backtraces presented we see that we are waiting for page
writeback to complete but I don't see anything that would be preventing the
bios from completing. Page writeback can submit quite large bios so it kind
of makes sense that it trips up some odd behavior. Looking at the code
I can see one possible problem in crypt_alloc_buffer() but it doesn't
explain why reducing initial page order would help. Anyway: Are we
guaranteed mempool has enough pages for arbitrarily large bio that can
enter crypt_alloc_buffer()? I can see crypt_page_alloc() does limit the
number of pages in the mempool to dm_crypt_pages_per_client plus I assume
the percpu counter bias in cc->n_allocated_pages can limit the really
available number of pages even further. So if a single bio is large enough
to trip percpu_counter_read_positive(&cc->n_allocated_pages) >=
dm_crypt_pages_per_client condition in crypt_page_alloc(), we can loop
forever? But maybe this cannot happen for some reason...

If this is not it, I think we need to find out why the writeback bios are
not completeting. Probably I'd start with checking what is kcryptd,
presumably responsible for processing these bios, doing.
