I'd definitely look at how the iommu code selects the address the target
side uses.
There is something very fishy going on.
With the iommu enabled whether bounce buffers get used should make no
difference - the address the device sees is different from the physical
address. But with a 32bit dma mask it should always generate low addresses
(regardless of the physical address of the buffer).

One possibility is the iommu code uses increasing addresses for each transf=
er
(to get uniqueness) but resets the address when idle.
That would mean the a single thread test would keep using the same address
(so it would stay low) but concurrent requests would keep using forever
larger addresses until the target starts aliasing the addresses (it puts
in the request TLP). At which point the requests should hit invalid iommu
pte (or whatever they are called) and the PCIe read/write should fail.
I'm not sure what the device would see - PCIe writes are 'posted' and
async, host reads of invalid addresses return ~0 and trigger an AER error
(if enabled and if anyone can manage to work out what to do, hint an NMI
into the host is not helpful on a 'nebs' rated server).

One effect of setting the dma mask to 32bits is to force swiotbl bounces
when they aren't needed because the iommu is disabled/absent.
I think you are probably using the wrong shaped hammer :-)
