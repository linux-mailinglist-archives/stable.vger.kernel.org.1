Subject: hugetlbfs: clear resv_map pointer if mmap fails
Date: Thu, 5 Oct 2023 23:59:06 -0400

Patch series "hugetlbfs: close race between MADV_DONTNEED and page fault", v7.

Malloc libraries, like jemalloc and tcalloc, take decisions on when to
call madvise independently from the code in the main application.

This sometimes results in the application page faulting on an address,
right after the malloc library has shot down the backing memory with
MADV_DONTNEED.

Usually this is harmless, because we always have some 4kB pages sitting
around to satisfy a page fault.  However, with hugetlbfs systems often
allocate only the exact number of huge pages that the application wants.

Due to TLB batching, hugetlbfs MADV_DONTNEED will free pages outside of
any lock taken on the page fault path, which can open up the following
race condition:

       CPU 1                            CPU 2

       MADV_DONTNEED
       unmap page
       shoot down TLB entry
                                       page fault
                                       fail to allocate a huge page
                                       killed with SIGBUS
       free page

Fix that race by extending the hugetlb_vma_lock locking scheme to also
cover private hugetlb mappings (with resv_map), and pulling the locking
from __unmap_hugepage_final_range into helper functions called from
zap_page_range_single.  This ensures page faults stay locked out of the
MADV_DONTNEED VMA until the huge pages have actually been freed.


This patch (of 3):

Hugetlbfs leaves a dangling pointer in the VMA if mmap fails.  This has
not been a problem so far, but other code in this patch series tries to
follow that pointer.
