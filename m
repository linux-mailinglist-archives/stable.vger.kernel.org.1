CFI generates instructions that can check the type of the function
against the caller. It appears that on 32-bit ARM, Clang close that,
in the case of a mismatch, it would cause a BKPT instruction to be
executed.

Linus' code in commit c3f89986fde7 ("ARM: 9391/2: hw_breakpoint:
Handle CFI breakpoints") added code to handle this BKPT use.

However, we now have a regression reported as a result of that commit
where there is a userspace program that has explicit BKPT instructions
encoded within it, and the program relies on the kernel behaviour that
was introduced in f81ef4a920c8 ("ARM: 6356/1: hw-breakpoint: add ARM
backend for the hw-breakpoint framework") in 2.6.37 - and this "new"
behaviour is conditional on CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS being enabled - where
it raises a SIGTRAP.

Prior to this commit, or whenever CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS is disabled, the
kernel will raise a SIGBUS instead.

Both SIGTRAP and SIGBUS are "forced" signals - the kernel will force
them to be delivered to the program irrespective of whether the program
has blocked or ignored these signals, since this is the kernel trying
to save the system (because it doesn't know how to handle it.)

Moreover, BKPT was only introduced around the ARMv5TE era, and the
FSR code for it was only added in later architecture reference manuals,
changing an existing FSR code from an implementation defined "Terminal
Exception" to an architecturally defined "Debug Exception".

Support for this "Debug Exception" was only added with patch 6356/1,
but that did not handle the BKPT instruction. Linus' commit above
(9391/1) added support for the CFI case, but meant that userspace
would now spin on a BKPT instruction rather than force a signal,
thereby causing the regression.

We can't fix BKPT handling - this userspace program relies on the fact
that the kernel doesn't handle this instruction (for example, it relies
on the PC not being advanced) and advancing the PC by one instruction
after a SIGTRAP handler returns may not be the correct way to handle
it anyway. Consider BKPT being used as an "assert" type context, where
the compiler doesn't expect execution to continue, and a literal pool
following the instruction.

We are now stuck with the sorry state that BKPT is, and as I have said
many times now, BKPT should be avoided - it's an utter trainwreck. The
only sensible use that BKPT has is with a hardware debugger that traps
the BKPT entry into debug mode (a special hardware debugger mode that
the CPU enters which software can't see).
