Exactly.  The OS should respect ACPI_FADT_NO_ASPM and _OSC.

I think there are a couple exceptions where we want to disable ASPM
even if the platform said the OS shouldn't touch ASPM at all, but
that's a special case.

Agreed.  It may not be practical to identify such devices, so we may
need a broader arch-based and/or date-based quirk.

I'd be shocked if Windows treated the BIOS config as a "do not exceed
this" situation, so my secret hope is that some of these "broken"
devices are really caused by defects in the Linux ASPM support or the
driver, and that we can fix them if we find out about them.

But I have no details about any of these alleged broken devices, so
it's hard to make progress on them.  Maybe we should log a debug note
if the device advertises ASPM support that BIOS didn't enable.
