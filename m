It helped to find the other issue. But the WARN_ON_ONCE() here is still 
plain wrong. Any only explained by my lack of understanding of the code 
and stupid assumptions I should have checked a bit more.

The warning always triggers when we have more than one user of the sg 
device (and then free one of them).
While trying to understand the issue I tripped over the other wrong 
sequence. Which is probably very seldom really executed...

That said I can of course update the wording when you have a better 
suggestion. But I only have some variations of "Ups... sorry. I thought 
that was a good idea. Turns out it's not"

The order was not wrong till commit db59133e9279 ("scsi: sg: fix 
blktrace debugfs entries leakage"), the one my original patch tried to 
fix. Prior to that one sg_device_destroy() was not using the scsi device 
request_queue.

I guess I (or one maintainer) could add that commit here again, too...

My reasoning here is, that this patch here fixes what my first patch got 
wrong.
Which is already heading into the stable trees. And I would prefer to 
not have any kernel release with commit 27f58c04a8f4 ("scsi: sg: Avoid 
sg device teardown race")  without this fix, too.

Hm, don't get that. That kref_put() is the one dropping the reference.
The matching kref_get() is in sg_add_sfp(). Which is called a few lines 
prior to the code here (line 350).

The patch is literally only swapping the order of scsi_device_put() and 
kref_put().

Which *again* causes a use-after free. So I'll send out v3 immediately 
and if any of the thinks discussed here require a v4 we'll do that.
