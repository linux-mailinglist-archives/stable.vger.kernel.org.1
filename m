Subject: writeback: fix dereferencing NULL mapping->host on writeback_page_template
Date: Tue, 6 Jun 2023 19:36:13 -0400

When commit 19343b5bdd16 ("mm/page-writeback: introduce tracepoint for
wait_on_page_writeback()") repurposed the writeback_dirty_page trace event
as a template to create its new wait_on_page_writeback trace event, it
ended up opening a window to NULL pointer dereference crashes due to the
(infrequent) occurrence of a race where an access to a page in the
swap-cache happens concurrently with the moment this page is being written
to disk and the tracepoint is enabled:

    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000040

This problem arises from the fact that the repurposed writeback_dirty_page
trace event code was written assuming that every pointer to mapping
(struct address_space) would come from a file-mapped page-cache object,
thus mapping->host would always be populated, and that was a valid case
before commit 19343b5bdd16.  The swap-cache address space
(swapper_spaces), however, doesn't populate its ->host (struct inode)
pointer, thus leading to the crashes in the corner-case aforementioned.

commit 19343b5bdd16 ended up breaking the assignment of __entry->name and
__entry->ino for the wait_on_page_writeback tracepoint -- both dependent
on mapping->host carrying a pointer to a valid inode.  The assignment of
__entry->name was fixed by commit 68f23b89067f ("memcg: fix a crash in
wb_workfn when a device disappears"), and this commit fixes the remaining
case, for __entry->ino.
