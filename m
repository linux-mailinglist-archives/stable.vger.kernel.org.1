That's fine, as long as that cherry-pick references the git id of the
original one.  Which did not happen here, and does NOT happen at all for
all drm branches (like AMD right now).

Which you obviously do not want me to do as you wanted that fix in the
tree sooner.

So this is a pain, but I'm kind of used to it by now as you all seem to
like this workflow for whatever reason...

Please fix.

That's still a major pain, as is your current workflow.  So until you
all fix this up, I will continue to complain as the existing way drm
patches flow into stable trees is a major pain which causes me to dread
looking at them every time.
