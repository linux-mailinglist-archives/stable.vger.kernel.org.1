From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 4c56a8ac6869855866de0bb368a4189739e1d24f ]

cgroup_drain_dying() was using cgroup_is_populated() to test whether there are
dying tasks to wait for. cgroup_is_populated() tests nr_populated_csets,
nr_populated_domain_children and nr_populated_threaded_children, but
cgroup_drain_dying() only needs to care about this cgroup's own tasks - whether
there are children is cgroup_destroy_locked()'s concern.

This caused hangs during shutdown. When systemd tried to rmdir a cgroup that had
no direct tasks but had a populated child, cgroup_drain_dying() would enter its
wait loop because cgroup_is_populated() was true from
nr_populated_domain_children. The task iterator found nothing to wait for, yet
the populated state never cleared because it was driven by live tasks in the
child cgroup.

Fix it by using cgroup_has_tasks() which only tests nr_populated_csets.

v3: Fix cgroup_is_populated() -> cgroup_has_tasks() (Sebastian).

v2: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260323200205.1063629-1-tj@kernel.org
