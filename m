Thanks a bunch to all of you folks! For the reviews and the suggestion
about the commit-ids. I've always sent patches to stable this way, be it
a backport or even a cherry-pick, but it's interesting and definitely
easier to just mention the IDs and ask for merge - thanks for the
suggestion, I'll do that in case of future clean cherry-picks =)

Cheers,


Guilherme
