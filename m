From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

[ Upstream commit 6bd23e0c2bb6c65d4f5754d1456bc9a4427fc59b ]

... and use it to limit the virtual terminals to just N_TTY.  They are
kind of special, and in particular, the "con_write()" routine violates
the "writes cannot sleep" rule that some ldiscs rely on.

This avoids the

   BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/printk/printk.c:2659

when N_GSM has been attached to a virtual console, and gsmld_write()
calls con_write() while holding a spinlock, and con_write() then tries
to get the console lock.

+ * struct tty_operations -- interface between driver and tty
+ *
+ * @lookup: ``struct tty_struct *()(struct tty_driver *self, struct file *,
+ *				    int idx)``
+ *
+ *	Return the tty device corresponding to @idx, %NULL if there is not
+ *	one currently in use and an %ERR_PTR value on error. Called under
+ *	%tty_mutex (for now!)
+ *
+ *	Optional method. Default behaviour is to use the @self->ttys array.
+ *
+ * @install: ``int ()(struct tty_driver *self, struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	Install a new @tty into the @self's internal tables. Used in
+ *	conjunction with @lookup and @remove methods.
+ *
+ *	Optional method. Default behaviour is to use the @self->ttys array.
+ *
+ * @remove: ``void ()(struct tty_driver *self, struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	Remove a closed @tty from the @self's internal tables. Used in
+ *	conjunction with @lookup and @remove methods.
+ *
+ *	Optional method. Default behaviour is to use the @self->ttys array.
+ *
+ * @open: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct file *)``
+ *
+ *	This routine is called when a particular @tty device is opened. This
+ *	routine is mandatory; if this routine is not filled in, the attempted
+ *	open will fail with %ENODEV.
+ *
+ *	Required method. Called with tty lock held. May sleep.
+ *
+ * @close: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct file *)``
+ *
+ *	This routine is called when a particular @tty device is closed. At the
+ *	point of return from this call the driver must make no further ldisc
+ *	calls of any kind.
+ *
+ *	Remark: called even if the corresponding @open() failed.
+ *
+ *	Required method. Called with tty lock held. May sleep.
+ *
+ * @shutdown: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine is called under the tty lock when a particular @tty device
+ *	is closed for the last time. It executes before the @tty resources
+ *	are freed so may execute while another function holds a @tty kref.
+ *
+ * @cleanup: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine is called asynchronously when a particular @tty device
+ *	is closed for the last time freeing up the resources. This is
+ *	actually the second part of shutdown for routines that might sleep.
+ *
+ * @write: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, const unsigned char *buf,
+ *		    int count)``
+ *
+ *	This routine is called by the kernel to write a series (@count) of
+ *	characters (@buf) to the @tty device. The characters may come from
+ *	user space or kernel space.  This routine will return the
+ *	number of characters actually accepted for writing.
+ *
+ *	May occur in parallel in special cases. Because this includes panic
+ *	paths drivers generally shouldn't try and do clever locking here.
+ *
+ *	Optional: Required for writable devices. May not sleep.
+ *
+ * @put_char: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, unsigned char ch)``
+ *
+ *	This routine is called by the kernel to write a single character @ch to
+ *	the @tty device. If the kernel uses this routine, it must call the
+ *	@flush_chars() routine (if defined) when it is done stuffing characters
+ *	into the driver. If there is no room in the queue, the character is
+ *	ignored.
+ *
+ *	Optional: Kernel will use the @write method if not provided. Do not
+ *	call this function directly, call tty_put_char().
+ *
+ * @flush_chars: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine is called by the kernel after it has written a
+ *	series of characters to the tty device using @put_char().
+ *
+ *	Optional. Do not call this function directly, call
+ *	tty_driver_flush_chars().
+ *
+ * @write_room: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine returns the numbers of characters the @tty driver
+ *	will accept for queuing to be written.  This number is subject
+ *	to change as output buffers get emptied, or if the output flow
+ *	control is acted.
+ *
+ *	The ldisc is responsible for being intelligent about multi-threading of
+ *	write_room/write calls
+ *
+ *	Required if @write method is provided else not needed. Do not call this
+ *	function directly, call tty_write_room()
+ *
+ * @chars_in_buffer: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine returns the number of characters in the device private
+ *	output queue. Used in tty_wait_until_sent() and for poll()
+ *	implementation.
+ *
+ *	Optional: if not provided, it is assumed there is no queue on the
+ *	device. Do not call this function directly, call tty_chars_in_buffer().
+ *
+ * @ioctl: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, unsigned int cmd,
+ *		    unsigned long arg)``
+ *
+ *	This routine allows the @tty driver to implement device-specific
+ *	ioctls. If the ioctl number passed in @cmd is not recognized by the
+ *	driver, it should return %ENOIOCTLCMD.
+ *
+ *	Optional.
+ *
+ * @compat_ioctl: ``long ()(struct tty_struct *tty, unsigned int cmd,
+ *			  unsigned long arg)``
+ *
+ *	Implement ioctl processing for 32 bit process on 64 bit system.
+ *
+ *	Optional.
+ *
+ * @set_termios: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct ktermios *old)``
+ *
+ *	This routine allows the @tty driver to be notified when device's
+ *	termios settings have changed. New settings are in @tty->termios.
+ *	Previous settings are passed in the @old argument.
+ *
+ *	The API is defined such that the driver should return the actual modes
+ *	selected. This means that the driver is responsible for modifying any
+ *	bits in @tty->termios it cannot fulfill to indicate the actual modes
+ *	being used.
+ *
+ *	Optional. Called under the @tty->termios_rwsem. May sleep.
+ *
+ * @ldisc_ok: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, int ldisc)``
+ *
+ *	This routine allows the @tty driver to decide if it can deal
+ *	with a particular @ldisc.
+ *
+ *	Optional. Called under the @tty->ldisc_sem and @tty->termios_rwsem.
+ *
+ * @set_ldisc: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine allows the @tty driver to be notified when the device's
+ *	line discipline is being changed. At the point this is done the
+ *	discipline is not yet usable.
+ *
+ *	Optional. Called under the @tty->ldisc_sem and @tty->termios_rwsem.
+ *
+ * @throttle: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine notifies the @tty driver that input buffers for the line
+ *	discipline are close to full, and it should somehow signal that no more
+ *	characters should be sent to the @tty.
+ *
+ *	Serialization including with @unthrottle() is the job of the ldisc
+ *	layer.
+ *
+ *	Optional: Always invoke via tty_throttle_safe(). Called under the
+ *	@tty->termios_rwsem.
+ *
+ * @unthrottle: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine notifies the @tty driver that it should signal that
+ *	characters can now be sent to the @tty without fear of overrunning the
+ *	input buffers of the line disciplines.
+ *
+ *	Optional. Always invoke via tty_unthrottle(). Called under the
+ *	@tty->termios_rwsem.
+ *
+ * @stop: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine notifies the @tty driver that it should stop outputting
+ *	characters to the tty device.
+ *
+ *	Called with @tty->flow.lock held. Serialized with @start() method.
+ *
+ *	Optional. Always invoke via stop_tty().
+ *
+ * @start: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine notifies the @tty driver that it resumed sending
+ *	characters to the @tty device.
+ *
+ *	Called with @tty->flow.lock held. Serialized with stop() method.
+ *
+ *	Optional. Always invoke via start_tty().
+ *
+ * @hangup: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine notifies the @tty driver that it should hang up the @tty
+ *	device.
+ *
+ *	Optional. Called with tty lock held.
+ *
+ * @break_ctl: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, int state)``
+ *
+ *	This optional routine requests the @tty driver to turn on or off BREAK
+ *	status on the RS-232 port. If @state is -1, then the BREAK status
+ *	should be turned on; if @state is 0, then BREAK should be turned off.
+ *
+ *	If this routine is implemented, the high-level tty driver will handle
+ *	the following ioctls: %TCSBRK, %TCSBRKP, %TIOCSBRK, %TIOCCBRK.
+ *
+ *	If the driver sets %TTY_DRIVER_HARDWARE_BREAK in tty_alloc_driver(),
+ *	then the interface will also be called with actual times and the
+ *	hardware is expected to do the delay work itself. 0 and -1 are still
+ *	used for on/off.
+ *
+ *	Optional: Required for %TCSBRK/%BRKP/etc. handling. May sleep.
+ *
+ * @flush_buffer: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine discards device private output buffer. Invoked on close,
+ *	hangup, to implement %TCOFLUSH ioctl and similar.
+ *
+ *	Optional: if not provided, it is assumed there is no queue on the
+ *	device. Do not call this function directly, call
+ *	tty_driver_flush_buffer().
+ *
+ * @wait_until_sent: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty, int timeout)``
+ *
+ *	This routine waits until the device has written out all of the
+ *	characters in its transmitter FIFO. Or until @timeout (in jiffies) is
+ *	reached.
+ *
+ *	Optional: If not provided, the device is assumed to have no FIFO.
+ *	Usually correct to invoke via tty_wait_until_sent(). May sleep.
+ *
+ * @send_xchar: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty, char ch)``
+ *
+ *	This routine is used to send a high-priority XON/XOFF character (@ch)
+ *	to the @tty device.
+ *
+ *	Optional: If not provided, then the @write method is called under
+ *	the @tty->atomic_write_lock to keep it serialized with the ldisc.
+ *
+ * @tiocmget: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty)``
+ *
+ *	This routine is used to obtain the modem status bits from the @tty
+ *	driver.
+ *
+ *	Optional: If not provided, then %ENOTTY is returned from the %TIOCMGET
+ *	ioctl. Do not call this function directly, call tty_tiocmget().
+ *
+ * @tiocmset: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty,
+ *		       unsigned int set, unsigned int clear)``
+ *
+ *	This routine is used to set the modem status bits to the @tty driver.
+ *	First, @clear bits should be cleared, then @set bits set.
+ *
+ *	Optional: If not provided, then %ENOTTY is returned from the %TIOCMSET
+ *	ioctl. Do not call this function directly, call tty_tiocmset().
+ *
+ * @resize: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct winsize *ws)``
+ *
+ *	Called when a termios request is issued which changes the requested
+ *	terminal geometry to @ws.
+ *
+ *	Optional: the default action is to update the termios structure
+ *	without error. This is usually the correct behaviour. Drivers should
+ *	not force errors here if they are not resizable objects (e.g. a serial
+ *	line). See tty_do_resize() if you need to wrap the standard method
+ *	in your own logic -- the usual case.
+ *
+ * @get_icount: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty,
+ *			 struct serial_icounter *icount)``
+ *
+ *	Called when the @tty device receives a %TIOCGICOUNT ioctl. Passed a
+ *	kernel structure @icount to complete.
+ *

+ * @get_serial: ``int ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct serial_struct *p)``
+ *

+ *
+ *	Optional: called only if provided, otherwise %ENOTTY will be returned.
+ *	Do not call this function directly, call tty_tiocgserial().

+ * @show_fdinfo: ``void ()(struct tty_struct *tty, struct seq_file *m)``
+ *
+ *	Called when the @tty device file descriptor receives a fdinfo request

+ *
+ *	Optional: called only if provided, otherwise nothing is written to @m.

+ *	driver.
+ *
+ * @poll_get_char: ``int ()(struct tty_driver *driver, int line)``
+ *
+ *	kgdboc support (see @poll_init). @driver should read a character from a

+ * @poll_put_char: ``void ()(struct tty_driver *driver, int line, char ch)``
+ *

+ *	Optional: called only if @poll_init provided.
+ *
+ * @proc_show: ``int ()(struct seq_file *m, void *driver)``
+ *
+ *	Driver @driver (cast to &struct tty_driver) can show additional info in
