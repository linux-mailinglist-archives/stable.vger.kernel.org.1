In this case, the DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5 at 00:13.0 is a Header Type 1
(PCI-to-PCI bridge).  I assume it has a PCIe Capability that
identifies it as Root Port, and the secondary bus 05 is probably a
PCIe Link leading to a slot.

I found "lspci -v" output similar to this at
https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=ad154077da&log=lspci_all

> DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5 becomes 00:00.0

In this case, the DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5 at 00:00.0 looks like a Header
Type 0 device (not a bridge), and the bus 00 it is on is not a normal
PCIe Link.  Since it doesn't connect to a PCIe Link, 00:00.0 might not
have a PCIe Capability at all, or it could be an RCiEP.  Or it's
possible it has a PCIe Capability left over from the old model that
says it's a Root Port, although this would potentially confuse an OS.

The other bridges (00:09.0, 00:0a.0, etc) are probably PCIe Root
Ports, which are logically part of the Root Complex, so the Root
Complex would be implemented partly in the new CPU and partly in the
LS7A.

The connection between the new CPU and the LS7A might be electrically
similar to PCIe, but it's not part of a PCIe hierarchy that Linux
sees.  That connection would have to be managed in some non-PCI way,
the same as all PCI host bridges, i.e., by firmware, ACPI, or a Linux
native host bridge driver like pci-loongson.c.

Here's the current commit log:

  The LS7A chipset can be used as a downstream bridge that connects to
  a high-level host bridge, and in such case the DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5
  is used as the upstream port.

  Thus, always enable MSI caps of this port, otherwise downstream
  devices cannot use MSI.

In this configuration, DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5 is not a PCI-to-PCI bridge
itself.  It might be some sort of downstream end of a connection from
the CPU, but that's not really relevant here.  And DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5
doesn't have any devices directly downstream from it.

I think something like this would be clearer:

  The LS7A chipset can be used as part of a PCIe Root Complex with
  Loongson-3C6000 and similar CPUs.  In this case, DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5
  has a PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST class code, and it is a Type 0 Function
  whose config space provides access to Root Complex registers.

  The DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5 has an MSI Capability, and its MSI Enable
  bit must be set before other devices below the Root Complex can use
  MSI.  This is not the standard PCI behavior of MSI Enable, so the
  normal PCI MSI code does not set it.

  Set the DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5 MSI Enable bit via a quirk so other
  devices below the Root Complex can use MSI.

What do you think?
