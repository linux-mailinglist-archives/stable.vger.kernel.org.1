The discussion regarding this can be found here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/36iykr223vmcfsoysexug6s274nq2oimcu55ybn6ww4il3g3cv@cohflgdbpnq7/
we explored an alternative to the full revert here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/4687373.LvFx2qVVIh@rafael.j.wysocki/
unfortunately that didn't lead anywhere useful, so Rafael went with the
full revert you're seeing now.

Ultimately it seems to me that this "aggressiveness" on deep idle tradeoffs
will highly depend on your platform, but also your workload, Jasper Lake
in particular seems to favor deep idle states even when they don't seem
to be a 'good' choice from a purely cpuidle (governor) perspective, so
we're kind of stuck with that.

For teo we've discussed a tunable knob in the past, which comes naturally with
the logic, for menu there's nothing obvious that would be comparable.
But for teo such a knob didn't generate any further interest (so far).

That's the status, unless I missed anything?
