I think LOOKUP_NO_DOTDOT is potentially interesting for userspace as
RESOLVE_NO_DOTDOT. Though Jann's reply made me wonder: If some userspace
project wants to make sure that there are no ".." in the path while
allowing symlinks and ".." in symlinks then wouldn't it be easier and
cheaper for userspace to just manually check for ".." in the path
themselves? I mean RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS and RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS
alleviate some proper pain. Not just because an appropariate userspace
algorithm is very costly but also because it's hard to get right. But
with RESOLVE_NO_DOTOT it feels like a pretty mundane string-parsing
excercise that could be done in userspace. Although I may just lack
imagination.

As long as we only have this very limited in-kernel user I think just
using Jann's helper in this patch is probably good enough.
