We’ve previously had issues in this area that turned out to be kernel bugs. We didn’t change anything regarding journal sizes and only a recent kernel upgrade seemed to be relevant.

You mentioned you saw PSI showing a huge pressure ration, during the time, which
might be generated by the journal writeback and giving it's a SYNC write, IOs
will stall if your storage can't write it fast enough. IIRC, most of the threads
from the logs you shared were waiting for log space to be able to continue,
which causes the log to flush things to disk and of course increase IO usage.
If your storage can't handle these IO bursts, then you'll get the stalls you're
seeing.
I am not discarding a possibility you are hitting a bug here, but it so far
seems your storage is not being able to service IOs fast enough to avoid such IO
stalls, or something else throttling IOs, XFS seems just the victim.

Can you share the xfs_info of one of these filesystems? I'm curious about the FS
geometry.

Good enough.

I see. There were some improvements in the newer versions, so if you can rule
out any possibly fixed bug is worth it.
