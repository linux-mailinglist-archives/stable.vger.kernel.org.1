What does lspci look like for both the old HT and the new PCIe CPUs?

With the old HT CPU, I imagine this:

  [LS7A includes a HT port that doesn't appear as a PCI device and
  basically implements a PCIe Root Complex]
  00:00.0 Root Port to [bus 01-1f] (DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5)

With a new PCIe CPU, if DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5 is a PCIe Upstream Port,
it would be part of a switch, so I'm imagining something like this:

  00:00.0 Root Port to [bus 01-1f] (integrated into Loongson-3C6000)
  01:00.0 Upstream Port to [bus 02-1f] (DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5)
  02:00.0 Downstream Port to [bus 03-1f] (part of the LS7A switch)

In both cases, 00:00.0 and 01:00.0 (DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5) would be a
Type 1 device that is enumerated as a PCI-to-PCI bridge, which would
normally have a Class Code of 0x0604 (PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI).

But you're saying DEV_LS7A_PCIE_PORT5 has a Class Code of
PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST, which is 0x0600.  That would normally be a Type
0 device and would not have a secondary bus.

I'm fine with the quirk to work around this issue.  But the commit log
is confusing.
