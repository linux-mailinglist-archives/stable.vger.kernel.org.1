Also, you only really have about 1 more year left for this kernel
version, why not take the time to move any systems that are somehow
still using this to a more modern kernel instead?  What's preventing
that from happening?

Running any x86 systems on this old kernel right now is probably not a
good idea given the huge number of unfixed bugs in it...
