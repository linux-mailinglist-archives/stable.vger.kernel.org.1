6.13-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Andrii Nakryiko <andrii@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 98671a0fd1f14e4a518ee06b19037c20014900eb ]

For all BPF maps we ensure that VM_MAYWRITE is cleared when
memory-mapping BPF map contents as initially read-only VMA. This is
because in some cases BPF verifier relies on the underlying data to not
be modified afterwards by user space, so once something is mapped
read-only, it shouldn't be re-mmap'ed as read-write.

As such, it's not necessary to check VM_MAYWRITE in bpf_map_mmap() and
map->ops->map_mmap() callbacks: VM_WRITE should be consistently set for
read-write mappings, and if VM_WRITE is not set, there is no way for
user space to upgrade read-only mapping to read-write one.

This patch cleans up this VM_WRITE vs VM_MAYWRITE handling within
bpf_map_mmap(), which is an entry point for any BPF map mmap()-ing
logic. We also drop unnecessary sanitization of VM_MAYWRITE in BPF
ringbuf's map_mmap() callback implementation, as it is already performed
by common code in bpf_map_mmap().

Note, though, that in bpf_map_mmap_{open,close}() callbacks we can't
drop VM_MAYWRITE use, because it's possible (and is outside of
subsystem's control) to have initially read-write memory mapping, which
is subsequently dropped to read-only by user space through mprotect().
In such case, from BPF verifier POV it's read-write data throughout the
lifetime of BPF map, and is counted as "active writer".

But its VMAs will start out as VM_WRITE|VM_MAYWRITE, then mprotect() can
change it to just VM_MAYWRITE (and no VM_WRITE), so when its finally
munmap()'ed and bpf_map_mmap_close() is called, vm_flags will be just
VM_MAYWRITE, but we still need to decrement active writer count with
bpf_map_write_active_dec() as it's still considered to be a read-write
mapping by the rest of BPF subsystem.

Similar reasoning applies to bpf_map_mmap_open(), which is called
whenever mmap(), munmap(), and/or mprotect() forces mm subsystem to
split original VMA into multiple discontiguous VMAs.

Memory-mapping handling is a bit tricky, yes.
