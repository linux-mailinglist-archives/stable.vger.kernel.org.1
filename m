Sounds fair.

Well, this exact commit causes breakage on Jim's platform. That's why I've added
it as the fixes tag irrespective of the pwrctrl functionality.

Hmm, yeah. For this patch to work, one has to make sure that CONFIG_PCI_PWRCTRL
is not set. This requires not supporting the ATH11K/12K chipsets and Jim said
that they don't have a usecase for supporting these chipsets yet on the brcmstb
platform (which only the internal team uses to run mainline).

But reverting 2489eeb777af alone wouldn't fix this regression [1].

Which means, this patch will only get applied for v6.16. I don't understand how
that will ensure v6.15 is not broken (even after the revert).
