[ Upstream commit 0760d5d0e9f0c0e2200a0323a61d1995bb745dee ]

The Intel Mount Evans SoC's Integrated Management Complex uses the SPI
controller for access to a NOR SPI FLASH. However, the SoC doesn't
provide a mechanism to override the native chip select signal.

This driver doesn't use DMA for memory operations when a chip select
override is not provided due to the native chip select timing behavior.
As a result no DMA configuration is done for the controller and this
configuration is not tested.

The controller also has an errata where a full TX FIFO can result in
data corruption. The suggested workaround is to never completely fill
the FIFO. The TX FIFO has a size of 32 so the fifo_len is set to 31.
