[ Upstream commit fc973dcd73f242480c61eccb1aa7306adafd2907 ]

While we do need at least 3.6 for kernel-doc to work, and at least
3.7 for it to output functions and structs with parameters at the
right order, let the python binary be compatible with legacy
versions.

The rationale is that the Kernel build nowadays calls kernel-doc
with -none on some places. Better not to bail out when older
versions are found.

With that, potentially this will run with python 2.7 and 3.2+,
according with vermin:

	$ vermin --no-tips -v ./scripts/kernel-doc
	Detecting python files..
	Analyzing using 24 processes..
	2.7, 3.2     /new_devel/v4l/docs/scripts/kernel-doc
	Minimum required versions: 2.7, 3.2

3.2 minimal requirement is due to argparse.

The minimal version I could check was version 3.4
(using anaconda). Anaconda doesn't support 3.2 or 3.3
anymore, and 3.2 doesn't even compile (I tested compiling
Python 3.2 on Fedora 42 and on Fedora 32 - no show).

With 3.4, the script didn't crash and emitted the right warning:

	$ conda create -n py34 python=3.4
	$ conda activate py34
	python --version
        Python 3.4.5
        $ python ./scripts/kernel-doc --none include/media
	Error: Python 3.6 or later is required by kernel-doc
	$ conda deactivate

	$ python --version
	Python 3.13.5
        $ python ./scripts/kernel-doc --none include/media
	(no warnings and script ran properly)

Supporting 2.7 is out of scope, as it is EOL for 5 years, and
changing shebang to point to "python" instead of "python3"
would have a wider impact.

I did some extra checks about the differences from 3.2 and
3.4, and didn't find anything that would cause troubles:

	grep -rE "yield from|asyncio|pathlib|async|await|enum" scripts/kernel-doc

Also, it doesn't use "@" operator. So, I'm confident that it
should run (producing the exit warning) since Python 3.2.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

YES

Explanation

- Fixes real build bug
  - Current script uses f-strings, which cause a SyntaxError on Python <
    3.6 before any version check runs, breaking builds that invoke
    kernel-doc during compilation.
  - Evidence:
    - f-strings in `scripts/kernel-doc.py:311` and `scripts/kernel-
      doc.py:315`:
      - `print(f"{error_count} warnings as errors")`
      - `print(f"{error_count} errors")`
    - Early top-level imports pull in modules that also use modern
      syntax (and f-strings), compounding parse failures under old
      Python:
      - `scripts/kernel-doc.py:110-111` imports
        `kdoc_files`/`kdoc_output` at module import time.
      - `scripts/lib/kdoc/kdoc_parser.py` contains many f-strings (e.g.,
        `scripts/lib/kdoc/kdoc_parser.py:838`,
        `scripts/lib/kdoc/kdoc_parser.py:1181`,
        `scripts/lib/kdoc/kdoc_parser.py:1382`).
  - This breaks kernels built on systems where `python3` is 3.2–3.5
    (still seen on older distros). The kernel build invokes kernel-doc
    with `-none` in at least one path, so this is a real build-time
    problem:
    - `drivers/gpu/drm/i915/Makefile:429` runs:
      `$(srctree)/scripts/kernel-doc -none -Werror $<; touch $@`

- What the patch changes (and why it fixes it)
  - Defers imports of kernel-doc internals until after Python version
    check:
    - Changes from top-level imports (`scripts/kernel-doc.py:110-111`)
      to importing only after confirming `python_ver >= (3,6)` (per the
      diff). This prevents parsing `kdoc_*` modules under ancient
      Python.
  - Removes f-strings from this file so ancient Python can parse it:
    - Replaces f-strings with `%` formatting when printing counts (per
      diff; replaces the lines at `scripts/kernel-doc.py:311` and
      `scripts/kernel-doc.py:315`).
  - Adjusts behavior under old Python to avoid build breakage for the
    `--none` case only:
    - Previously: for Python < 3.6, the script logged a warning and
      unconditionally exited 0 (`scripts/kernel-doc.py:274-279`). That
      intent was to “avoid breaking compilation”, but it could not work
      on 3.2–3.5 due to parse errors.
    - Now: if Python < 3.6 and `--none` is used, it logs an error and
      exits 0 (“skipping checks”), preserving successful compilation. If
      `--none` is not used, it exits non-zero with a clear message. This
      avoids silent success when actually trying to generate docs and
      aligns behavior to intent in the commit message.

- Scope and risk
  - Small, contained change to documentation tooling only
    (`scripts/kernel-doc.py`).
  - No architectural changes and no impact on the running kernel.
  - Behavioral change only affects the corner-case of Python < 3.6:
    - For `--none`, it keeps builds succeeding (previous intent), now
      actually working because parse errors are avoided.
    - For real doc generation on ancient Python, it now fails explicitly
      instead of silently returning 0 with no output — a safer and
      clearer behavior.
  - Imports are moved inside `main()` after version gating; otherwise
    functionality is unchanged for supported Python versions.

- Stable backport suitability
  - Fixes a concrete build-time crash/regression on older build
    environments when the kernel build triggers kernel-doc with `-none`.
  - Minimal risk and fully confined to a script in `scripts/`.
  - No new features or interfaces introduced.
  - Note on applicability: only relevant to trees that already have the
    Python-based `scripts/kernel-doc`/`scripts/kernel-doc.py`. Trees
    that still use the Perl `scripts/kernel-doc` are unaffected by this
    bug and do not need this patch.

Conclusion: This is a targeted, low-risk build fix to avoid spurious
failures on older Python during kernel builds that call `kernel-doc
-none`. It meets stable rules for important bugfixes with minimal risk
and should be backported (to branches with the Python kernel-doc
script).
