To be fair, this one seems to have been an accident. The same commit was
cherry-picked to *two* different branches by two different people
[1][2], and this is something we try not to do. Any cherry-picks should
go to one tree only, it's checked by our scripts, but it's not race free
when two people are doing this roughly at the same time.
