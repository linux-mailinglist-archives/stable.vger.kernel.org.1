They are in our "to get to" queue, which is very long still due to
multiple conferences and travel.

But I will note, you didn't put the git id of the patches in the patches
themselves, so it will take me extra work to add them there when
applying.

Also, why just 6.1?  What about newer stable kernels?  You can't update
and have a regression, right?

thanks,
