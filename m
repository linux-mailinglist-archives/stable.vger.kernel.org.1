Maintainers can ask for their portions of the kernel to be not included
in the AUTOSEL work, and many have, please see:
	https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/stable-queue.git/tree/ignore_list
for the current list of things that are excluded.

That does not work at all.  The whole reason AUTOSEL is used is because
maintainers and developers are NOT tagging things that are bugfixes.  We
have whole subsystems that just don't do anything, and this is the only
way we can get fixes for that area included in stable kernels.

Again, we allow any subsystem to opt-out entirely from this if they so
desire, AND we allow many chances for a patch to be dropped, AND we
later allow anything to be reverted.  Heck, we have maintainers who just
don't want to deal with stable kernels at all, and that's fine, I'm not
going to impose that burden on them if they do not want to.  But in that
case, we will do spelunking through the tree to find stuff that affects
users.

If you look at the history of AUTOSEL, I think the number of real bugs
has shown that overall, it works really well.  Sure it will mess up at
times, we're all human, and all we can do then is to be sure to react
and fix the issue.
