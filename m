From: Luis Chamberlain <mcgrof@kernel.org>

commit 1dc8689e4cc651e21566e10206a84c4006e81fb1 upstream.

Expand documentation to clarify:

  o that paths don't need to exist for the new API callers
  o clarify that we *require* callers to keep the memory of
    the table around during the lifetime of the sysctls
  o annotate routines we are trying to deprecate and later remove
