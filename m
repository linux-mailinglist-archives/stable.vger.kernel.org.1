Subject: mm: enforce a minimal stack gap even against inaccessible VMAs
Date: Tue, 08 Oct 2024 00:55:39 +0200

As explained in the comment block this change adds, we can't tell what
userspace's intent is when the stack grows towards an inaccessible VMA.

I have a (highly contrived) C testcase for 32-bit x86 userspace with glibc
that mixes malloc(), pthread creation, and recursion in just the right way
such that the main stack overflows into malloc() arena memory.

I don't know of any specific scenario where this is actually exploitable,
but it seems like it could be a security problem for sufficiently unlucky
userspace.

I believe we should ensure that, as long as code is compiled with
something like -fstack-check, a stack overflow in it can never cause the
main stack to overflow into adjacent heap memory.

My fix effectively reverts the behavior for !vma_is_accessible() VMAs to
the behavior before commit 1be7107fbe18 ("mm: larger stack guard gap,
between vmas"), so I think it should be a fairly safe change even in case
A.
