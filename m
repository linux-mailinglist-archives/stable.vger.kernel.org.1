Okay, so long as you don't keep a comment that is now incorrect.

Again, I don't care too much about the exact wording; I just want to 
make sure that the log message isn't actually wrong.  Saying "expected 
255" would definitely be wrong, but saying "expected at least 9" would 
be okay.

Yeah, don't bother to fix up comments that the patch doesn't otherwise 
touch -- that would be mere pointless churn and would make reviewing the 
patch more difficult for no good reason.  But comments that you _do_ 
alter are fair game for reformatting.

Sort of.  Software that parses the descriptors later on will ignore the 
extra stuff in any case, limiting itself to just the first wTotalLength 
bytes.  So there's not really any need to keep the excess.

The critical fields are not just the first 4 bytes, but the first 9 
bytes.  If you want, you can change that test against 4 above, making it 
against USB_DT_CONFIG_SIZE.  The reason the existing code only tests 
against 4 is because it knows that it will issue another request for the 
full length, but that won't always be true after your changes.

You're right that the existing code could have reallocated the buffer if 
it received less than it asked for.  I believe it doesn't bother to do 
this because that possibility is considered to be very unlikely.

In fact, you could arrange to do the check and reallocation after the 
two code paths merge back together.  That would be the best solution.

Yes, that seems like a better choice for the name.  Or maybe 
USB_CONFIG_BIG_REQ_SIZE or USB_CONFIG_WINDOWS_REQ_SIZE, to indicate this 
isn't the value we normally use but copies the behavior of Windows.
