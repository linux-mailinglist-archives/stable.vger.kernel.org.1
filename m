I analyzed this issue and performed a simple local reproduction using
smb3/smb21:

mount /dev/sda /mnt
mount -t cifs //127.0.0.1/share /mnt/test_mnt -o vers=3.0,guest
# smb versions below 3 do not support fallocate;
# generic/694 replaces it with pwrite.
# xfs_io -ft -c "pwrite 0 4G" /mnt/test_mnt/aaa
xfs_io -ft -c "falloc 0 4M" /mnt/test_mnt/aaa
stat -c "%b" /mnt/test_mnt/aaa
umount /mnt/test_mnt
mount -t cifs //127.0.0.1/share /mnt/test_mnt -o vers=3.0,guest
stat -c "%b" /mnt/test_mnt/aaa

xfs_io -ft -c "falloc 0 4M" /mnt/test_mnt/aaa opens the file for
writing, which causes stat -> ... -> update_inode_info to skip updating
inode->i_blocks, because is_size_safe_to_change() returns false.

The file is only removed from the list in _cifsFileInfo_put(), but that
call is deferred, so the value obtained in step 3 doesn't match the
expected value. Step 6, however, does match — because after the remount
the file has not been opened for writing.

Before the patch was merged, both runs returned 0, because the second
mount reused the sb instance and the inode instance from the first
mount, and the interval between the two mounts was too short, causing
cifs_dentry_needs_reval() to return false.

SMB 2.1 behaves similarly: pwrite writes 4 GB and the size shows as
8388608. If the server-side backing filesystem is ext4, it also
initially shows 8388608(see ext4_file_getattr()), and only during the
writeback path — when it's discovered that the extent count is too
large and an additional ETB(extent tree block) is required — does it
become 8388616(ext4_do_writepages -> ... -> ext4_ext_new_meta_block).

On the client side, cifs_write_end() updates inode->i_blocks but doesn't
account for that metadata block. Although generic/694 issues a sync
before stat, and the server flushes to disk upon receiving it, so by
rights it should return 8388616 — it doesn't. This is because
cifs_revalidate_dentry_attr() -> cifs_dentry_needs_reval() returns false
directly, since CIFS_CACHE_READ evaluates to true; as a result, it
doesn't even go to the server to fetch stat.

The oplock is only cleared to 0 in _cifsFileInfo_put(), and that itself
is a deferred release, so the stat call never picks up the actual data
from the remote server before _cifsFileInfo_put() called.


On the other hand, why is there no problem with cifs/smb2, and the issue
only appears on smb21/smb3?

The difference is that prior to smb21, there was no concept of leases —
only oplocks:

smb2_set_oplock_level
   cinode->lease_granted = false

smb21_set_oplock_level
   cinode->lease_granted = true

This means that on cifs/smb2, cifs_close() invokes _cifsFileInfo_put()
immediately (rather than going through the deferred-close path), so the
problem described above doesn't occur.



I'm new to SMB, so this is very much a beginner's analysis. I hope it's
useful to others, and I'd really appreciate it if anyone could point out
mistakes or things I've gotten wrong.

Thanks,
Zizhi Wo
