[ Upstream commit 99012014c902cd9ad85fd288d8a107f33a69855e ]

If genpd_alloc_data() allocates data for the default power-states for the
genpd, let's make sure to also reset the pointer in the error path. This
makes sure a genpd provider driver doesn't end up trying to free the data
again, but using an invalid pointer.

Based on the detailed analysis of the code and the commit changes, I can
now provide a comprehensive answer. **YES** This commit should be
backported to stable kernel trees. Here's my extensive analysis: ## Bug
Analysis The commit fixes a memory management bug in the power domain
subsystem's error handling path. In `genpd_alloc_data()`, when default
power states are allocated via `genpd_set_default_power_state()`, the
function sets: - `genpd->states = state` (pointing to allocated memory)
- `genpd->free_states = genpd_free_default_power_state` However, in the
error path (`put:` label at line 2197-2198), the code frees the
allocated states memory with `kfree(genpd->states)` but **does not reset
the pointer to NULL**. This leaves a dangling pointer in
`genpd->states`. ## The Problem If `genpd_alloc_data()` fails and
returns an error, but the genpd provider driver later tries to clean up
and calls `genpd_free_data()` (which happens in `genpd_remove()` at line
2214), the following sequence occurs: 1. `genpd_free_data()` checks `if
(genpd->free_states)` - this is still set to
`genpd_free_default_power_state` 2. It calls
`genpd->free_states(genpd->states, genpd->state_count)` 3. This results
in `kfree(genpd->states)` being called on already-freed memory (double-
free) This is a classic use-after-free/double-free vulnerability that
can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or potential security issues. ##
The Fix The fix is simple but crucial: after `kfree(genpd->states)` in
the error path, it adds `genpd->states = NULL`. This ensures that: 1.
The dangling pointer is eliminated 2. Future calls to
`genpd_free_data()` will call `kfree(NULL)`, which is safe and does
nothing 3. No double-free occurs ## Backport Criteria Assessment **1.
Does it fix a bug that affects users?** YES - This can cause kernel
crashes and memory corruption when power domain initialization fails.
**2. Is the fix small and contained?** YES - It's a single line addition
(`genpd->states = NULL`). **3. Does it have clear side effects?** NO -
Setting a pointer to NULL after freeing it is a standard safe practice
with no negative side effects. **4. Major architectural changes?** NO -
This is a simple bug fix in error handling. **5. Critical kernel
subsystem?** YES - Power domain management is critical for power
management across many devices. **6. Explicit stable mention?** NO - But
this type of memory safety fix is exactly what stable trees are for.
**7. Follows stable rules?** YES - Important bugfix with minimal risk.
## Risk Assessment **Risk: MINIMAL** - The change only affects the error
path and makes the code safer by preventing double-free. There's
virtually no risk of regression since it only changes behavior when an
error has already occurred. ## Similar Commit Patterns This follows the
same pattern as **Similar Commit #1 and #4** which were both marked as
**YES** for backporting - they fix memory management bugs in the same
subsystem with minimal, contained changes that improve robustness
without architectural changes. The fix prevents a potential security
vulnerability (memory corruption) and improves system stability, making
it an excellent candidate for stable tree backporting.
