Right there, that fails with how the drm tree works.  So you are going
to have to come up with something else for how to check this.  Or fix
your process to make this work.

Look at the commits tagged for stable in the -rc1 merge window.  They
don't have the "cherry picked" wording as they were not cherry picked!
They were the "originals" that were cherry picked from.

Then your tooling needs to be fixed.

And that's not in Linus's tree.

Ok, but again, the original is not in Linus's tree.

So how am I do know that the cherry picked line was already in the tree?
Added it twice is odd, but really, that's not the common failure here at
all.  The real problem is the -rc1 window where there is NOT a commit id
that can be matched up with (as it happening with a few commits here,
and with lots of AMD patches now.)
