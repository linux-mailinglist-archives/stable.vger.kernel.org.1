Right, but some architectures have non-VMA ranges in userland (yuck), and
ptdump is the only case where we really do this. It sucks really.

I'm not sure if it's ok to just stop outputting this information.

But as you say, we don't actually have to worry about this if we're RCU
freeing.

The arches are powerpc, s390, arm64, x86 and riscv and indeed all set
MMU_GATHER_RCU_TABLE_FREE.

But it's more complicated than that unfortunately. As per mmu_gather.c -
'Semi RCU freeing of the page directories'.

And MMU_GATHER_RCU_TABLE_FREE != RCU page table freeing.

You can see the complexity in Qi's commit 718b13861d22 ("x86: mm: free page
table pages by RCU instead of semi RCU").

Basically you need the IRQs disabled to get the semi-RCU behaviour and to
be able to safely traverse page tables that way.

So with CONFIG_PT_RECLAIM you're safe to RCU traverse PTEs only.

Looking at the Kconfig entry:

config PT_RECLAIM
	def_bool y
	depends on MMU_GATHER_RCU_TABLE_FREE && !HAVE_ARCH_TLB_REMOVE_TABLE

And indeed, we fall back to just freeing PTE page tables immediately
(relying on IPI sync) if it's not set:

#ifdef CONFIG_PT_RECLAIM
static inline void __tlb_remove_table_one_rcu(struct rcu_head *head)
{
	struct ptdesc *ptdesc;

	ptdesc = container_of(head, struct ptdesc, pt_rcu_head);
	__tlb_remove_table(ptdesc);
}

static inline void __tlb_remove_table_one(void *table)
{
	struct ptdesc *ptdesc;

	ptdesc = table;
	call_rcu(&ptdesc->pt_rcu_head, __tlb_remove_table_one_rcu);
}
#else
static inline void __tlb_remove_table_one(void *table)
{
	tlb_remove_table_sync_rcu();
	__tlb_remove_table(table);
}
#endif /* CONFIG_PT_RECLAIM */

HAVE_ARCH_TLB_REMOVE_TABLE is set for powerpc, which also enables PTDUMP :)
and that's because it actually tracks multiple PTE page tables together as
a fragment.

So in general - it's unfortunately not so easy, and we can't just rely on
RCU.

Obviously the above is moreso about userland mappings, but it suggests that
_just_ removing page tables under RCU isn't sufficient here.

You'd also need a lockless ptdump walker to carefully handle the weird edge
cases as per pmdp_get_lockless() and ptep_get_lockless(), which the kernel
page table wlakers not currently using.

In the case of kernel page tables we can just always RCU defer page table
freeing (having audited all callers to make sure nobody's freeing them in a
broken way).

But I wonder how the PPC fragment page tables stuff would interact with
that, it's something that'd need to be audited.

Yup.

Yes the ideal situation is that we don't have to worry about an mmap or VMA
lock at all and can stabilise on RCU only.

Well only for ptdump.

Yeah sorry! It's kinda immaterial now anyway :P as we're discussing in

Yeah it is, I'll send a patch.

There could be torn writes observed that would need careful revalidation
checks though couldn't there potentially?

See e.g. contpte_ptep_get_lockless() and pmdp_get_lockless() if
CONFIG_GUP_GET_PXX_LOW_HIGH.

And things are complicated in kernel code obviously by the fact you have no
PTL guarantees anymore.

And OK maybe we can prove the huge promotion case is OK, this assumes that
we won't in future free kernel page tables under some other
circumstances... :)

I'm not saying it's not doable though, just that we have to be _very
careful_ how we do it if we're going to try to do this under RCU!

Well I wonder about torn writes actually, you'd need to be careful about
revalidating in the walk.

In general Ithink all the problems are ultimately solveable, they're just
fiddly :)
