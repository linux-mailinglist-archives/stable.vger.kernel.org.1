[ Upstream commit ca88ecdce5f51874a7c151809bd2c936ee0d3805 ]

We currently have two ways to identify CPUs that only implement FEAT_VHE
and not FEAT_E2H0:

- either they advertise it via ID_AA64MMFR4_EL1.E2H0,
- or the HCR_EL2.E2H bit is RAO/WI

However, there is a third category of "cpus" that fall between these
two cases: on CPUs that do not implement FEAT_FGT, it is IMPDEF whether
an access to ID_AA64MMFR4_EL1 can trap to EL2 when the register value
is zero.

A consequence of this is that on systems such as Neoverse V2, a NV
guest cannot reliably detect that it is in a VHE-only configuration
(E2H is writable, and ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1 is 0), despite the hypervisor's
best effort to repaint the id register.

Replace the RAO/WI test by a sequence that makes use of the VHE
register remnapping between EL1 and EL2 to detect this situation,
and work out whether we get the VHE behaviour even after having
set HCR_EL2.E2H to 0.

This solves the NV problem, and provides a more reliable acid test
for CPUs that do not completely follow the letter of the architecture
while providing a RES1 behaviour for HCR_EL2.E2H.
