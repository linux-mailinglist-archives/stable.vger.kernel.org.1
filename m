The quilt patch titled
     Subject: mm: add a call to flush_cache_vmap() in vmap_pfn()
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-add-a-call-to-flush_cache_vmap-in-vmap_pfn.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into the mm-hotfixes-stable branch
of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Subject: mm: add a call to flush_cache_vmap() in vmap_pfn()
Date: Wed, 9 Aug 2023 18:46:33 +0200

flush_cache_vmap() must be called after new vmalloc mappings are installed
in the page table in order to allow architectures to make sure the new
mapping is visible.

It could lead to a panic since on some architectures (like powerpc),
the page table walker could see the wrong pte value and trigger a
spurious page fault that can not be resolved (see commit f1cb8f9beba8
("powerpc/64s/radix: avoid ptesync after set_pte and
ptep_set_access_flags")).

But actually the patch is aiming at riscv: the riscv specification
allows the caching of invalid entries in the TLB, and since we recently
removed the vmalloc page fault handling, we now need to emit a tlb
shootdown whenever a new vmalloc mapping is emitted
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20230725132246.817726-1-alexghiti@rivosinc.com/).
That's a temporary solution, there are ways to avoid that :)
