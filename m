Subject: mm: make mapping_evict_folio() the preferred way to evict clean folios
Date: Wed, 8 Nov 2023 18:28:04 +0000

Patch series "Fix fault handler's handling of poisoned tail pages".

Since introducing the ability to have large folios in the page cache, it's
been possible to have a hwpoisoned tail page returned from the fault
handler.  We handle this situation poorly; failing to remove the affected
page from use.

This isn't a minimal patch to fix it, it's a full conversion of all the
code surrounding it.


This patch (of 6):

invalidate_inode_page() does very little beyond calling
mapping_evict_folio().  Move the check for mapping being NULL into
mapping_evict_folio() and make it available to the rest of the MM for use
in the next few patches.
