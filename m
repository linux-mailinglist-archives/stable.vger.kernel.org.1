Yeah sashiko reminded me of this, I had glossed over it :)

I already came up with a fix at [0], I think it's fine to just take the init_mm
lock in this case.

x86 is the only case in which an arbitrary process mm is read (fun!) arm64 does
the efi_mm thing too.

Well there's 2 that are correct because you are actually traversing both
ranges...

Yeah this is misleading, and I misunderstood on assumption x86 wouldn't and
 be so silly to... and didn't read the code too closely assuming you did
 this PAGE_OFFSET split and... yeah :)) guys :)

I mean that'd break userspace though wouldn't it?

It's actually the least awful of all of these I think :) and the one I
implemented ([0]).

It logically makes sense because there's nothing that relies on an
arbitrary mm in order to acquire an mmap lock around the init_mm. None of
the mitigation relies on that.

Also the user mappings (modulo PTI obv) share kernel mappings, so it's
actually logical and reasonable to hold both.

I don't love this. It feels a hack for x86 that's put in the wrong place,
i.e. core code.

And can you can make this assumption for efi_mm for all arches? Could other
arches might be weird about this?

No :) please no.

 Implementing a crazy RCU scheme just for ptdump was already mad enough,
but this is begging for an RCU stall. It's just not the right tool for
this.

Literally the issue is vmap (and CPA it turns out) not properly locking
when freeing page tables.

The convention already exists that the mmap lock on init_mm is how we
handle this kind of thing and everything fits except vmap, CPA which I've
now fixed.

And with [0] I fix this too :)

It's icky but the least bad IMO.

Another way forwards might be simply have the caller _call
ptdump_walk_pgd() twice_ once with the range set to [0, PAGE_OFFSET) passing whatever mm
!= init_mm, and again for [PAGE_OFFSET, ~0) passing init_mm?

Are there cases where you expect to see a delta in the kernel range in x86
for an arbitrary mm?

And would this work for efi_mm and also for arm64?

So far I think the 2 locks thing, as horrid as it is is the least fraught
way. And we have a live UAF here so good to get a fix in ASAP.

Thanks, Lorenzo
