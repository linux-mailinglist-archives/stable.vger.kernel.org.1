I doubt that we're anywhere close to the power levels we need to measure

No, that's not what we want.

As part of entering and exiting CXPC, the system will switch the
resources related to the GDSC between CX and some other rail (generally
some form of MX). In other words, the hardware will "reparent" the
resources under the hood. So we do want to leave the GDSC in a "active,
but according to software inactive" state, and we need to let go of the
votes on the parents.


We typically list e.g. CX as the parent of the GDSC, giving us the two
side effects: 1) an active GDSC casts an active vote on the CX, 2) a
performance_state vote on the GDSC will trickle up to CX.

In particular the latter allow us to describe devices with a single
power-domain, and let them through that relationship cast votes on CX.
See e.g. &usb_1_ss0 in hamoa.dtsi; the GDSC doesn't have a concept of
performance states, but to sustain the given assigned-clock-rates we
need to keep CX at NOM.

I think you should rather see it as a question of does the requester
need the power to be on. In many/most cases you have some form of logic
or reference counting between the consumer and the actual hardware
switch.

So a client doesn't vote for a resource to be turned off, it rather
removes its vote for it to be on. The layers below will then aggregate
votes, implement sleep timeouts etc, and might turn off the power.

This world view does makes sense, but instead of keeping CX as a
"retention" level, the Qualcomm platform retain state through some other
power rail, allowing CX to collapse fully - bringing with it all those
parts that hasn't been built or configured to switch to retention power.

In the downstream Qualcomm kernels you can find various mechanism for
client drivers to dynamically change this behavior for both clocks and
GDSCs. There has been "corner cases" through history where in certain
use cases you want retention and in other don't.

No such APIs exists in the PM or clock APIs.

That idea that the responsibility for making such decisions would better
lie with the client I agree with.

But on the other hand, extending the APIs to allow such fine grained
tweaks makes the system more integrated and complex. Conceptually I
would prefer us moving towards the Linux power model, with individual
devices having an abstract power state, rather than sprinkling tweaks
throughout.


Ultimately, I don't think this it's worth exposing such controls. We're
orders of magnitude away from decent power consumption in sleep, and we
still can't boot the system reliably without clk_ignore_unused. Once
we're past that, I'd be happy to be proven wrong by some measurements.
