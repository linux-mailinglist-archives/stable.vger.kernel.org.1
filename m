Good point, we need the NUMA awareness in both sync and async probe
paths.

But node affinity is orthogonal to the sync/async question, so it
seems weird to deal with affinity in two separate places.  It also
seems sub-optimal to have node affinity in the driver core async path
but not the synchronous probe path.

Maybe driver_probe_device() should do something about NUMA affinity?
