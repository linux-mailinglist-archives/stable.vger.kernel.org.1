Okay.  The appraisal result of the overlay file is being cached and not
cleared on file change of the lower file.

Perhaps instead of introducing a new "action" (measure/dont_measure,
appraise/dont_appraise, audit), it should be more granular at the
policy rule level. 
Something like ignore_cache/dont_ignore_cache, depending on the
default.

Eric, does that make sense?

If you're using a modified "ima_tcb" there are "measure" action rules
which would cause files to be re-measured.  Look at the IMA measurement
list.

If you're only accessing files via the overlayfs and not the lower
layer, then there wouldn't be any audit records.
