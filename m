commit 4984563823f0034d3533854c1b50e729f5191089 upstream.

Extend VMX's nested intercept logic for emulated instructions to handle
"pause" interception, in quotes because KVM's emulator doesn't filter out
NOPs when checking for nested intercepts.  Failure to allow emulation of
NOPs results in KVM injecting a #UD into L2 on any NOP that collides with
the emulator's definition of PAUSE, i.e. on all single-byte NOPs.

For PAUSE itself, honor L1's PAUSE-exiting control, but ignore PLE to
avoid unnecessarily injecting a #UD into L2.  Per the SDM, the first
execution of PAUSE after VM-Entry is treated as the beginning of a new
loop, i.e. will never trigger a PLE VM-Exit, and so L1 can't expect any
given execution of PAUSE to deterministically exit.

  ... the processor considers this execution to be the first execution of
  PAUSE in a loop. (It also does so for the first execution of PAUSE at
  CPL 0 after VM entry.)

All that said, the PLE side of things is currently a moot point, as KVM
doesn't expose PLE to L1.

Note, vmx_check_intercept() is still wildly broken when L1 wants to
intercept an instruction, as KVM injects a #UD instead of synthesizing a
nested VM-Exit.  That issue extends far beyond NOP/PAUSE and needs far
more effort to fix, i.e. is a problem for the future.
