For some perspective, encrypting or decrypting 4 KiB messages with AES-128-XTS
serially, I get 18.4 GB/s per thread with the VAES-accelerated code on an Intel
Emerald Rapids processor.  (The code is arch/x86/crypto/aes-xts-avx-x86_64.S,
which I wrote and contributed in Linux 6.10.)  The processor appeared to be
running at about 3.28 GHz.  That's about 5.6 bytes per cycle.

Emerald Rapids processors have 6 to 60 cores per socket.  Even assuming that a
second thread in each core provides no benefit due to competing for the same
core's resources, that would be an AES-128-XTS throughput of 110 to 1100 GB/s.

That's way more than QAT could provide, even under the optimal conditions which
do not exist in reality as QAT is much harder to use than VAES.

FWIW, on an AMD EPYC 9B45 (Zen 5 / Turin) server processor, I get 35.2 GB/s.
This processor appeared to run at about 4.15 GHz, so that's about 8.5 bytes per
cycle.  That's 51% more bytes per cycle than Intel.  This shows that there is
still room for improvement in VAES, even when it's already much better than QAT.

It's unclear why Intel's efforts seem to be focused on QAT instead of VAES.
