I'm confused about this.  Assume there is a pwrctrl device and the
related PCI device is already powered on when Linux boots.  Apparently
we do NOT want to enumerate the PCI device?  We want to wait for the
pwrctrl driver to claim the pwrctrl device and do a rescan?  Even
though the pwrctrl driver may be a loadable module and may not even be
available at all?

It seems to me that a PCI device that is already powered on should be
enumerated and made available.  If there's a pwrctrl device for it,
and we decide to load pwrctrl, then we also get the ability to turn
the PCI device off and on again as needed.  But if we *don't* load
pwrctrl, it seems like we should still be able to use a PCI device
that's already powered on.

I was assuming pwrctrl is only required if we want to turn the PCI
device power on or off.  Maybe that's not true?

If the PCI device is already powered on, what more should we do to
fully reset and initialize it?  If it needed more initialization, I
assume the platform should have left it powered off.

I'm just as confused as I was before.  I'm assuming pwrctrl basically
gives us a way to control the main power rails to the PCI device, and 
the device only depends on pwrctrl in the sense that pwrctrl can
remove main power and put the device in D3cold, and then restore main
power so the device can return to D0uninitialized.
