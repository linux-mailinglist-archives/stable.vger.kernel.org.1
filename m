I believe there is some testing done.  However for a lot of what I see
go by I would be strongly surprised if there is actually much manual
review.

I expect there is a lot of the changes are simply ignored after a quick
glance because people don't know what is going on, or they are of too
little consequence to spend time on.

Several objections.
- The explanation was clearly bogus.
- The maintainer takes alarm.
- The patch while small, is not simple and not obviously correct.
- The patch has not been thoroughly tested.

I object because the code does not appear to have been well tested
outside of the realm of fixing the issue.

There is no indication that the kexec code path has ever been exercised.

So this appears to be one of those changes that was merged under
the banner of "Let's see if this causes a regression".

To the original authors.  I would have appreciated it being a little
more clearly called out in the change description that this came in
under "Let's see if this causes a regression".

Such changes should not be backported automatically.  They should be
backported with care after the have seen much more usage/testing of
the kernel they were merged into.  Probably after a kernel release or
so.  This is something that can take some actual judgment to decide,
when a backport is reasonable.

It was a bit more than line wraps.  At first glance I thought
it was just removing a prefix from the links.  On second glance
it appears it is completely making a hash of links:

The links in question:
https://github.com/ROCm/ROCK-Kernel-Driver/issues/174
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2362

The unusable restatement of those links:
ROCm/ROCK-Kernel-Driver#174
freedesktop.org/drm/amd#2362

Short of knowing to look up into the patch to find the links,
those references are completely junk.

As I said.  I expect that the process looking at the output of
get_maintainers.pl and ignoring a change when my name is returned
will result in effectively the entire core kernel and the user/kernel
ABI not being eligible for backport.

I bring this up because I was not an author and I did not have any
signed-off-by's on the change in question, and yet I was still selected
for the review.
