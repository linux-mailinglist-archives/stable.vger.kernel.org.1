Lo! From the earlier discussion[1] it seems the mainline developers of
the patch-set don't care (which is fine). And the stable team always has
a lot of work at hand, which might explain why they haven't looked into
this. Hence let me try to fill this gap a little here by asking:

Have you tried if reverting the change on top of the latest 4.14.y
kernel works and looks safe (e.g. doesn't cause a regression on its own)?

I also briefly looked into "git log v4.14..v4.19 --
arch/arm/boot/dts/meson.dtsi" and noticed commit 291f45dd6da ("ARM: dts:
meson: fixing USB support on Meson6, Meson8 and Meson8b") [v4.15-rc1]
that mentions a fix for the Odroid-C1+ board -- which afaics wasn't
backported to 4.14.y. Is that maybe why this happens on 4.14.y and not
on 4.19.y? Note though: It's just a wild guess from the peanut gallery,
as this is not my area of expertise!

Ciao, Thorsten
