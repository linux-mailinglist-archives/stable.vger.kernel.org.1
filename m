5.15-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

[ Upstream commit 14f043f1340bf30bc60af127bff39f55889fef26 ]

The kernel-doc of timer related functions is partially uncomprehensible
word salad. Rewrite it to make it useful.
