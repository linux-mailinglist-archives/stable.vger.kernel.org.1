But this limitation of the ASPM enable implementation wasn't really an
issue before pwrctrl since, as you point out above, these controllers
are not hotplug capable.

We've also discussed the rc=134 issue, which appears to be due to some
pwrctrl race. IIRC, you thought it may be the bluetooth driver powering
down the bt/wlan controller before the wlan bit has had a chance to
(complete its) probe. Not sure if that was fully confirmed, but I
remember you saying that the rc=134 symptom would no longer be visible
since 6.15 and instead wlan would never even probe at all if we hit this
issue...

The patch you link to above only appears to relate to drivers being
manually unbound. I hope we're not also hitting such issues during
regular boot?

Sounds good. Thanks.
