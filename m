[ Upstream commit 653361585d251fbca0e19ac58b04ba95dd01e378 ]

After falling back to the previous item in btrfs_delete_raid_extent(),
the code uses ASSERT(found_start <= start) to verify the found extent
actually precedes our target range. If the B-tree state is unexpected
(e.g. no overlapping extent exists), this triggers a kernel BUG/panic
in debug builds, or silently continues with wrong data otherwise.

Replace the ASSERT with a proper bounds check that returns -ENOENT if
the found extent does not actually overlap with the start position.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## Phase 1: Commit Message Forensics
Step 1.1 Record: Subsystem `btrfs`; action verb `replace`; intent is to
replace an assertion in `btrfs_delete_raid_extent()` with real error
handling for stripe lookup fallback.

Step 1.2 Record: Tags in commit
`653361585d251fbca0e19ac58b04ba95dd01e378`: `Signed-off-by: robbieko
<robbieko@synology.com>`, `Reviewed-by: David Sterba
<dsterba@suse.com>`, `Signed-off-by: David Sterba <dsterba@suse.com>`.
No `Fixes:`, no `Reported-by:`, no `Tested-by:`, no `Link:`, no `Cc:
stable`.

Step 1.3 Record: The commit says that after fallback to the previous
item, `ASSERT(found_start <= start)` can BUG/panic when B-tree state is
unexpected, and non-assert builds can continue with wrong stripe data.
Root cause described: the previous item found may not actually overlap
the requested deletion range.

Step 1.4 Record: This is not hidden cleanup. It is explicitly a bug fix:
it converts an invariant-only check into a runtime bounds check
returning `-ENOENT`.

## Phase 2: Diff Analysis
Step 2.1 Record: One file changed: `fs/btrfs/raid-stripe-tree.c`, 4
insertions, 1 deletion. One function changed:
`btrfs_delete_raid_extent()`. Scope: single-file surgical fix.

Step 2.2 Record: Before, fallback loaded the previous key, computed
`found_start` and `found_end`, then asserted only `found_start <=
start`. After, it returns `-ENOENT` and exits the delete loop if
`found_start > start` or `found_end <= start`. This affects the stripe
extent deletion lookup path after `btrfs_search_slot()` chooses an item
after the deletion start and the code backs up to a candidate previous
item.

Step 2.3 Record: Bug category is logic/correctness with data-integrity
implications. Broken mechanism: the fallback candidate was assumed to
overlap the deletion start. The fix verifies both start and end bounds
before later code can truncate, split, or delete a stripe extent.

Step 2.4 Record: Fix quality is high: the check is local, easy to reason
about, and preserves existing error propagation. Regression risk is low,
but not zero: returning `-ENOENT` changes a previous silent/no-op path
into transaction abort at the caller. That is appropriate because the
caller already aborts on `btrfs_delete_raid_extent()` errors and the
condition means the stripe mapping lookup is inconsistent for the
deletion being performed.

## Phase 3: Git History Investigation
Step 3.1 Record: `git blame` shows the fallback block and
`ASSERT(found_start <= start)` were introduced by `76643119045eed`
(`btrfs: fix deletion of a range spanning parts two RAID stripe
extents`), first contained in `v6.14-rc1`. The broader partial deletion
machinery was introduced by `6aea95ee318890`, first contained in
`v6.13-rc1`.

Step 3.2 Record: No `Fixes:` tag is present, so there was no tagged
introducer to follow. Blame identifies the direct introducer.

Step 3.3 Record: Recent `master` history shows this was patch 4 in a
six-patch raid-stripe-tree deletion fix set: preceding fixes include
copying `devid`, fixing leaf-boundary lookup, and fixing
`btrfs_previous_item()` `min_objectid`; following fixes handle `-EAGAIN`
and missing return checks. The commit applies cleanly to the current
`stable/linux-7.0.y` checkout by itself, but it is best considered with
the neighboring raid-stripe-tree deletion fixes.

Step 3.4 Record: Author `robbieko` has multiple adjacent `fs/btrfs/raid-
stripe-tree.c` fixes in `master`. Reviewer/committer David Sterba is
listed as Btrfs maintainer in `MAINTAINERS`. Johannes Thumshirn, who
reviewed other patches in the series, has substantial prior raid-stripe-
tree history in the same file.

Step 3.5 Record: No new helper, structure, API, or external dependency
is introduced. Syntactically standalone: `git apply --check` of the
candidate patch succeeded on the current `stable/linux-7.0.y` checkout.
Semantically, it complements the surrounding lookup fixes.

## Phase 4: Mailing List And External Research
Step 4.1 Record: `b4 dig -c 653361585d251...` found the original
submission at `https://patch.msgid.link/20260413065249.2320122-5-
robbieko@synology.com`. `b4 dig -a -C` showed only v1. The thread was a
six-patch series titled `btrfs: fix multiple bugs in raid-stripe-tree
deletion path`.

Step 4.2 Record: `b4 dig -w` showed the original recipients were
`robbieko` and `linux-btrfs@vger.kernel.org`. In-thread
review/maintainer discussion involved David Sterba and Johannes
Thumshirn. David added the series to `for-next`.

Step 4.3 Record: No `Reported-by:` or `Link:` tag exists for an external
bug report. No syzbot or bugzilla report was present in the commit or
mbox.

Step 4.4 Record: Related patches found in the same series:
`513f8a52eed88`, `2aef5cb1dcf9b`, `1871ae78ffa5c`, `fe0cdfd7118d8`, and
`a8d58a7c02009`. The cover letter states all six fix bugs in raid-
stripe-tree deletion/partial deletion paths.

Step 4.5 Record: No stable-specific nomination was found in the mbox.
WebFetch attempts to lore/stable and lore/all were blocked by Anubis, so
external stable-list search could not be independently verified.

## Phase 5: Code Semantic Analysis
Step 5.1 Record: Modified function: `btrfs_delete_raid_extent()`.

Step 5.2 Record: Callers found by search: production caller
`do_free_extent_accounting()` in `fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c`, plus Btrfs
raid-stripe-tree selftests. `do_free_extent_accounting()` calls
`btrfs_delete_raid_extent()` for data extents and aborts the transaction
on error.

Step 5.3 Record: Key callees in `btrfs_delete_raid_extent()` include
`btrfs_find_chunk_map()`, `btrfs_need_stripe_tree_update()`,
`btrfs_search_slot()`, `btrfs_previous_item()`, `btrfs_del_item()`,
`btrfs_duplicate_item()`, and `btrfs_partially_delete_raid_extent()`.

Step 5.4 Record: Reachability verified: file extent removal paths call
`btrfs_free_extent()`, delayed refs call `__btrfs_free_extent()`, and
when refs reach zero `do_free_extent_accounting()` calls
`btrfs_delete_raid_extent()`. `btrfs_fallocate()` calls
`btrfs_punch_hole()` for `FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE`, which calls
`btrfs_replace_file_extents()`, which calls `btrfs_drop_extents()`,
which calls `btrfs_free_extent()`. So users with write access to files
on an affected Btrfs filesystem can reach this path via hole punching;
other data extent deletion paths also reach it.

Step 5.5 Record: Similar nearby issue pattern found in the same series:
multiple small fixes to `btrfs_delete_raid_extent()` and
`btrfs_partially_delete_raid_extent()` addressing missed entries, wrong
previous-item bounds, stale leaf pointer, missing `devid`, and unchecked
return values.

## Phase 6: Stable Tree Analysis
Step 6.1 Record: The directly blamed fallback code is first in
`v6.14-rc1`; merge-base checks show it is not in `v6.13`, but is in
`v6.14`, `v6.15`, `v6.16`, and `v7.0`. It is therefore relevant to
stable trees based on `v6.14+`, including the current
`stable/linux-7.0.y` checkout.

Step 6.2 Record: Backport difficulty is low. `git apply --check` of the
candidate patch onto current `stable/linux-7.0.y` succeeded. Neighboring
series patches also applied cleanly in the same check.

Step 6.3 Record: Local stable refs `stable/linux-6.16.y` and
`stable/linux-7.0.y` do not contain the candidate or the adjacent April
2026 raid-stripe-tree deletion fixes checked by subject/ancestor tests.

## Phase 7: Subsystem And Maintainer Context
Step 7.1 Record: Subsystem is Btrfs filesystem, specifically raid-
stripe-tree. Criticality: important, because it is filesystem
data/extent mapping code, but affected population is feature-specific
rather than universal.

Step 7.2 Record: Subsystem activity is high. Recent history in
`fs/btrfs/raid-stripe-tree.c` shows many fixes and follow-up selftests.
The feature is also exposed only under `CONFIG_BTRFS_EXPERIMENTAL` sysfs
feature attributes in this tree, so impact is limited to systems using
that feature.

## Phase 8: Impact And Risk Assessment
Step 8.1 Record: Affected users are Btrfs users with `RAID_STRIPE_TREE`
enabled and stripe-tree updates needed for data block group profiles
covered by `BTRFS_RST_SUPP_BLOCK_GROUP_MASK`.

Step 8.2 Record: Trigger conditions: deleting/freeing data extents on
such filesystems when stripe lookup fallback selects a non-overlapping
candidate. Verified reachable through file hole punching and delayed-ref
extent free paths. I did not verify a concrete reproducer for the exact
bad B-tree state.

Step 8.3 Record: Failure mode severity is high. With
`CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT`, `ASSERT()` calls `BUG()`, so this can crash the
kernel. Without that assertion code generated, the later deletion logic
can operate on a non-overlapping stripe extent, which is a filesystem
mapping corruption risk. If the previous candidate ends before the
target, the old code could also silently stop with success.

Step 8.4 Record: Benefit is high for affected users because it prevents
panic or wrong stripe-tree mutation in filesystem deletion code. Risk is
low because the patch is a four-line validation check in one function
and changes invalid lookup state into an error returned to an existing
transaction-abort path.

## Phase 9: Final Synthesis
Step 9.1 Record: Evidence for backporting: real filesystem correctness
bug, possible kernel BUG in assert builds, possible wrong stripe mapping
mutation in non-assert builds, one-file minimal patch, maintainer review
by David Sterba, merged by Linus via Btrfs fixes pull, applies cleanly
to current stable checkout, affected code exists in `v6.14+`. Evidence
against: feature-specific and experimental; no concrete external bug
report or reproducer found; part of a six-patch series, so stable
maintainers should consider taking the nearby deletion fixes too.
Unresolved: no successful WebFetch of lore/stable search due Anubis;
exact real-world frequency not verified.

Step 9.2 Record: Stable rules checklist:
1. Obviously correct and tested: mostly yes by inspection and maintainer
   review; no explicit `Tested-by`.
2. Fixes a real bug: yes, invalid stripe lookup fallback handling in
   deletion path.
3. Important issue: yes for affected users, because panic and filesystem
   mapping corruption are serious.
4. Small and contained: yes, 4 insertions/1 deletion in one function.
5. No new features/APIs: yes.
6. Can apply to stable: yes on current `stable/linux-7.0.y`; relevant
   for `v6.14+` trees.

Step 9.3 Record: No exception category applies. This is not a device ID,
quirk, DT, build, or documentation patch.

Step 9.4 Record: Decision is to backport. The limited affected
population does not outweigh the severity and low risk: this is a tiny
filesystem correctness fix for code already present in recent stable
trees.
