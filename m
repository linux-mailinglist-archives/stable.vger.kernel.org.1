After further investigation, it seems that the softdeps have
already seen a fair amount of abuse for what they actually aren't
intended, i.e. resolving hard dependencies.  For example, have
a look at the commit d5178578bcd4 (btrfs: directly call into
crypto framework for checksumming) [1] and the lines containing
MODULE_SOFTDEP() at the very end of fs/btrfs/super.c. [2]

If a filesystem driver can rely on the abuse of softdeps, which
admittedly are a bit fragile, I think we can follow the same
approach, at least for now.

With all that in mind, I think that accepting this patch, as well
as the related Panfrost patch, [3] should be warranted.  I'd keep
investigating the possibility of introducing harddeps in form
of MODULE_HARDDEP() and the related support in kmod project,
similar to the already existing softdep support, [4] but that
will inevitably take a lot of time, both for implementing it
and for reaching various Linux distributions, which is another
reason why accepting these patches seems reasonable.
