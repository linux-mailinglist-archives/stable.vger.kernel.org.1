Yeah, correct.

The problem is not all the UPDATE cases in MDS will encode and pass the 
'split_realms' list to clients via the MClientSnap requests. By reading 
Zheng's commit I think he just copied that code to one UPDATE case from 
old SPLIT case and didn't notice it will introduce this issue in kclient.

Sending the 'split_realms' is unnecessary and useless in client side for 
UPDATE case, we should fix it in MDS side too.
