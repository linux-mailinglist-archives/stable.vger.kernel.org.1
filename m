Our intent was that these are zeroed at build time in the Image. If the
vmlinux isn't consistent with that, that's a problem with the way we
generate the vmlinux, and hence "the ELF representation is inaccurate".

I agree with Ard that it's better to bring the vmlinux into line with
that (if we need to handlr this at all), even if that means making the
vmlinux a few KB bigger.

Mark.
