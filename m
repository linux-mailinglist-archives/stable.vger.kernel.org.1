6.1-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Steven Rostedt (Google) <rostedt@goodmis.org>

commit f458a1453424e03462b5bb539673c9a3cddda480 upstream.

Since 64 bit cmpxchg() is very expensive on 32bit architectures, the
timestamp used by the ring buffer does some interesting tricks to be able
to still have an atomic 64 bit number. It originally just used 60 bits and
broke it up into two 32 bit words where the extra 2 bits were used for
synchronization. But this was not enough for all use cases, and all 64
bits were required.

The 32bit version of the ring buffer timestamp was then broken up into 3
32bit words using the same counter trick. But one update was not done. The
check to see if the read operation was done without interruption only
checked the first two words and not last one (like it had before this
update). Fix it by making sure all three updates happen without
interruption by comparing the initial counter with the last updated
counter.
