It was pointed out[1] that using folio_test_hwpoison() is wrong as we need
to check the indiviual page that has poison.  folio_test_hwpoison() only
checks the head page so go back to using PageHWPoison().

User-visible effects include existing hwpoison-inject tests possibly
failing as unpoisoning a single subpage could lead to unpoisoning an
entire folio.  Memory unpoisoning could also not work as expected as
the function will break early due to only checking the head page and
not the actually poisoned subpage.
