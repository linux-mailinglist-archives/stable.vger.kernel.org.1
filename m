[ Upstream commit 5de6951fedb29700ace53b283ccb951c8f712d12 ]

folio_trylock() in erofs_try_to_free_all_cached_folios() may
successfully acquire the folio lock, but the subsequent check
for erofs_folio_is_managed() can skip unlocking when the folio
is not managed by EROFS.

As Gao Xiang pointed out, this condition should not happen in
practice because compressed_bvecs[] only holds valid cached folios
at this point — any non-managed folio would have already been
detached by z_erofs_cache_release_folio() under folio lock.

Fix this by adding DBG_BUGON() to catch unexpected folios
and ensure folio_unlock() is always called.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Now I have a complete picture. Let me compile my analysis.

---

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

### Step 1.1: PARSE THE SUBJECT LINE
Record: [erofs] [ensure] "ensure all folios are managed in
erofs_try_to_free_all_cached_folios()" — the verb "ensure" strongly
indicates a correctness/bug fix. The function is part of the erofs
shrinker path.

### Step 1.2: PARSE ALL COMMIT MESSAGE TAGS
- **Suggested-by:** Gao Xiang <hsiangkao@linux.alibaba.com> — the EROFS
  maintainer suggested this fix
- **Signed-off-by:** Zhan Xusheng <zhanxusheng@xiaomi.com> — author from
  Xiaomi
- **Reviewed-by:** Gao Xiang <hsiangkao@linux.alibaba.com> — EROFS
  maintainer reviewed
- **Reviewed-by:** Chunhai Guo <guochunhai@vivo.com> — additional
  reviewer
- **Signed-off-by:** Gao Xiang <hsiangkao@linux.alibaba.com> —
  maintainer SOB (applied through his tree)
- No Fixes: tag (expected for commits under review)
- No Cc: stable (expected)
- No Reported-by

Record: Fix was suggested and reviewed by the EROFS maintainer. Two
independent reviewers.

### Step 1.3: ANALYZE THE COMMIT BODY TEXT
The commit explains:
- `folio_trylock()` may succeed, acquiring the folio lock
- The subsequent `erofs_folio_is_managed()` check can cause a `continue`
  that **skips the `folio_unlock()`**
- Gao Xiang notes this shouldn't happen "in practice" because
  compressed_bvecs[] should only hold managed folios
- Any non-managed folio would have been detached by
  `z_erofs_cache_release_folio()` under folio lock

Record: Bug = folio lock leak when `!erofs_folio_is_managed` is true
after `folio_trylock` succeeds. Failure mode = folio stays locked
forever → deadlock. Maintainer says the condition is theoretically
impossible in practice.

### Step 1.4: DETECT HIDDEN BUG FIXES
Record: This IS a real bug fix (folio lock leak/deadlock), presented
with the "ensure" verb. The `continue` after acquiring a lock without
releasing it is an obvious code defect regardless of whether the path is
reachable.

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

### Step 2.1: INVENTORY THE CHANGES
- **fs/erofs/zdata.c**: -2 lines, +1 line (net -1 line)
- Function modified: `erofs_try_to_free_all_cached_folios()`
- Scope: single-file, single-function, single-line surgical fix

Record: Extremely small change — 1 file, 1 function, net -1 line.

### Step 2.2: UNDERSTAND THE CODE FLOW CHANGE
Before: After `folio_trylock(folio)` succeeds, if
`!erofs_folio_is_managed(sbi, folio)`, the code does `continue` —
skipping `folio_unlock(folio)` on lines 611-612.

After: The `if/continue` is replaced with
`DBG_BUGON(!erofs_folio_is_managed(sbi, folio))`. The code always falls
through to `folio_unlock(folio)`.

Record: Before = folio left locked on `continue` path. After = folio
always unlocked.

### Step 2.3: IDENTIFY THE BUG MECHANISM
This is a **lock leak** (folio lock not released). Category:
synchronization/resource leak. If the folio remains locked, any
subsequent attempt to lock it (by reclaim, migration, or other code
paths) would block indefinitely → **deadlock**.

Record: Bug = folio lock leak. Mechanism = `continue` after
`folio_trylock` without `folio_unlock`. Category = resource leak /
potential deadlock.

### Step 2.4: ASSESS THE FIX QUALITY
- Obviously correct: removing the `continue` ensures `folio_unlock()` is
  always reached
- Minimal/surgical: 1 line replaced
- Regression risk: extremely low — in production builds, `DBG_BUGON` is
  a no-op `((void)(x))`, so the code simply proceeds to unlock
- In debug builds, `DBG_BUGON` becomes `BUG_ON` which would crash, but
  only if the assertion condition fires

Record: Fix is obviously correct, minimal, and carries near-zero
regression risk.

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

### Step 3.1: BLAME THE CHANGED LINES
The buggy `if (!erofs_folio_is_managed)/continue` pattern at lines
608-609 was introduced by commit `2080ca1ed3e432` ("erofs: tidy up
`struct z_erofs_bvec`", Gao Xiang, 2024-07-03), merged in v6.12 cycle.

However, the same bug pattern existed BEFORE that commit in the page-
based version. Tracing further back through `706fd68fce3a5` (v6.9, folio
conversion), and even to the original `105d4ad857dcbf` (v4.19, staging
era), the page-based `trylock_page`/`continue` pattern also leaked the
page lock. In v5.4, the check was `page->mapping != mapping` instead of
`erofs_page_is_managed`, but the bug (continue without unlock after
trylock) was the same.

Record: Bug is long-standing, present since v5.4 in page form,
persisting through folio conversions. Present in ALL stable trees with
EROFS compressed data support.

### Step 3.2: FOLLOW THE FIXES: TAG
No Fixes: tag present (expected).

### Step 3.3: CHECK FILE HISTORY
Recent zdata.c changes show active development. The function has been
modified during refactoring (folio conversion, bvec tidy-up, lockref
changes) but the lock leak bug was never addressed.

Record: Standalone fix, no prerequisites needed.

### Step 3.4: CHECK THE AUTHOR
Zhan Xusheng from Xiaomi. The fix was suggested by Gao Xiang (EROFS
maintainer), who also reviewed it. This carries high credibility.

Record: Fix suggested and reviewed by subsystem maintainer.

### Step 3.5: CHECK FOR DEPENDENCIES
The fix is self-contained. It modifies only the body of
`erofs_try_to_free_all_cached_folios()`. No dependencies on other
commits. For older stable trees (v6.6 and earlier), the fix would need
adaptation to the page-based API.

Record: Self-contained fix, but needs adaptation for page-based stable
trees.

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH

### Step 4.1-4.5: MAILING LIST INVESTIGATION
Lore.kernel.org is behind bot protection. Web search found no specific
patch discussion for this commit. The commit was applied through Gao
Xiang's tree (signed-off by him).

Record: Could not access lore discussion. The commit's review chain
(suggested-by + 2 reviewed-by + maintainer SOB) provides sufficient
confidence.

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

### Step 5.1: KEY FUNCTIONS
Modified function: `erofs_try_to_free_all_cached_folios()`

### Step 5.2: TRACE CALLERS
Called from:
1. `__erofs_try_to_release_pcluster()` (line 894) — called from shrinker
   path
2. Which is called from `erofs_try_to_release_pcluster()` (line 913) and
   `z_erofs_put_pcluster()` (line 954)
3. `z_erofs_shrink_scan()` (line 930) iterates pclusters and calls this
4. `erofs_shrink_scan()` (line 282) is the registered shrinker callback

The shrinker is invoked by the kernel's memory reclaim subsystem under
memory pressure — this is a commonly-hit path on any system using EROFS
with compressed data.

Record: Called from kernel shrinker path → triggered during memory
pressure. Common execution path.

### Step 5.3-5.5: CALL CHAIN AND PATTERNS
The function is reachable whenever the kernel is under memory pressure
and an EROFS filesystem with compressed data is mounted. This is a core
memory management path for EROFS — not obscure.

Record: Reachable from core memory reclaim path.

## PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AND STABLE TREE ANALYSIS

### Step 6.1: BUGGY CODE EXISTS IN STABLE TREES
Verified the bug exists in:
- **v5.4**: `trylock_page` + `page->mapping != mapping` → `continue`
  (lock leak)
- **v5.15**: `trylock_page` + `!erofs_page_is_managed` → `continue`
  (lock leak)
- **v6.1**: same as v5.15
- **v6.6**: same as v5.15
- **v6.9, v6.12**: folio-based `folio_trylock` +
  `!erofs_folio_is_managed` → `continue` (lock leak)

Record: Bug exists in ALL active stable trees (v5.4+).

### Step 6.2: BACKPORT COMPLICATIONS
- v6.9+: patch applies cleanly or with minimal context adjustment
  (folio-based)
- v6.6 and earlier: needs adaptation to page-based API
  (`trylock_page`/`unlock_page`/`erofs_page_is_managed`)
- Function signature differs in older trees (takes `struct
  erofs_workgroup *grp` parameter)

Record: Clean apply for v6.9+; needs rework for v6.6 and earlier.

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT

### Step 7.1: SUBSYSTEM CRITICALITY
- **Subsystem**: fs/erofs — Enhanced Read-Only Filesystem
- **Criticality**: IMPORTANT — used in Android, embedded systems,
  containers
- This is a filesystem's memory management path, not an obscure driver

Record: EROFS is an actively used filesystem, especially in
Android/embedded contexts.

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

### Step 8.1: WHO IS AFFECTED
Users of EROFS with compressed data (common use case — EROFS is
primarily a compressed read-only filesystem). Especially Android
devices.

### Step 8.2: TRIGGER CONDITIONS
The trigger requires: (1) EROFS filesystem mounted with compressed data,
(2) memory pressure causing shrinker to run, (3) a folio in
compressed_bvecs[] that is not managed. Condition (3) is believed to be
impossible in practice per the maintainer.

Record: Trigger requires a "theoretically impossible" condition. But if
it occurs, it would be during common memory pressure events.

### Step 8.3: FAILURE MODE SEVERITY
If triggered: folio locked forever → deadlock/hang. Severity:
**CRITICAL** (if triggered) but probability believed to be near zero.

### Step 8.4: RISK-BENEFIT RATIO
- **Benefit**: Prevents potential deadlock; eliminates a code
  correctness bug; defense-in-depth
- **Risk**: Near zero — the fix removes a `continue` and replaces it
  with a no-op assertion (in production builds). The code path proceeds
  to `folio_unlock()` which is always correct.
- **Ratio**: Very favorable — high potential benefit, near-zero risk

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

### Step 9.1: EVIDENCE COMPILATION

**FOR backporting:**
- Fixes a real code correctness bug (folio/page lock leak on `continue`
  path)
- If triggered, causes a deadlock (CRITICAL severity)
- Fix is surgical: 1 line, 1 function, 1 file
- Obviously correct — ensures unlock after lock
- Reviewed and suggested by EROFS maintainer (Gao Xiang)
- Bug exists in ALL stable trees since v5.4
- Zero regression risk
- Shrinker path is commonly executed

**AGAINST backporting:**
- Maintainer says the condition "should not happen in practice"
- No user reports of this bug triggering
- Needs adaptation for older (page-based) stable trees

### Step 9.2: STABLE RULES CHECKLIST
1. Obviously correct and tested? **YES** — maintainer reviewed, trivial
   fix
2. Fixes a real bug? **YES** — folio lock leak (even if theoretically
   unreachable)
3. Important issue? **YES** — deadlock if triggered
4. Small and contained? **YES** — net -1 line
5. No new features/APIs? **YES**
6. Can apply to stable? **YES** — cleanly for v6.9+, with adaptation for
   older trees

### Step 9.3: EXCEPTION CATEGORIES
Not an exception category — this is a standard bug fix.

### Step 9.4: DECISION
The fix eliminates a real code correctness defect (missing
`folio_unlock` on a control flow path after `folio_trylock`). While the
maintainer believes the condition can't happen in practice, the fix is
surgical, obviously correct, carries zero regression risk, and prevents
a deadlock if the condition ever did trigger. The code path is in the
kernel's memory reclaim shrinker — a commonly exercised subsystem. The
fix meets all stable kernel criteria.
