6.1-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Sagi Grimberg <sagi@grimberg.me>

[ Upstream commit c758b77d4a0a0ed3a1292b3fd7a2aeccd1a169a4 ]

In nvmet_sq_destroy we capture sq->ctrl early and if it is non-NULL we
know that a ctrl was allocated (in the admin connect request handler)
and we need to release pending AERs, clear ctrl->sqs and sq->ctrl
(for nvme-loop primarily), and drop the final reference on the ctrl.

However, a small window is possible where nvmet_sq_destroy starts (as
a result of the client giving up and disconnecting) concurrently with
the nvme admin connect cmd (which may be in an early stage). But *before*
kill_and_confirm of sq->ref (i.e. the admin connect managed to get an sq
live reference). In this case, sq->ctrl was allocated however after it was
captured in a local variable in nvmet_sq_destroy.
This prevented the final reference drop on the ctrl.

Solve this by re-capturing the sq->ctrl after all inflight request has
completed, where for sure sq->ctrl reference is final, and move forward
based on that.

This issue was observed in an environment with many hosts connecting
multiple ctrls simoutanuosly, creating a delay in allocating a ctrl
leading up to this race window.
