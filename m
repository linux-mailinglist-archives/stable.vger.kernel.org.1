Yeah, that is what I figured. Can we *please* stop doing stupid stuff
like that for arch code, especially arch/x86, which is well looked
after? (In my personal opinion, we should not be using AUTOSEL at all,
but that seems to be a lost battle)

Especially for this patch in particular, which touches the kexec code,
which is easy to break and difficult to fix. Whether the patch applies
without breaking the build is entirely irrelevant (and even that seems
a high bar for stable trees these days). Nobody should be touching any
of that code without actually testing whether or not kexec still
works.

There should not be a need for people to object to something that no
actual person ever suggested in the first place.

The only responsible way to use AUTOSEL is to make it opt-in rather
than opt-out. And I object to the idea that it is ok for someone like
Sasha to run a bot that generates lots of emails to lots of people,
and put the burden on everyone else to spend actual time and mental
effort to go over all those patches and decide whether or not they
might the stable candidates, especially without any due diligence
whatsoever regarding whether the resulting kernel still boots and runs
correctly on a system that actually exercises the updated code.
