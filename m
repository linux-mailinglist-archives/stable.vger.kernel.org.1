Given the recent addition of the port map mask, we could restore this print as
an info level.

This one is weird. It should be an error print.

> ata_dev_dbg(dev, "disabling queued TRIM support\n");

This is also OK to restore as an info print. But given that, there are a lot
more horkage disabling features that we probably should print.
