Definitely it won't be happening.

Also, Linus effectively only allows regression fixes during -rc phase=20
anymore (he stated his policy change around -rc5 timeframe). I therefore=20
moved even some of queued new HW support patches from the pdx86 fixes=20
branch into for-next.

I usually only stop accepting large series around that time, with some
exceptions. (We've one such exception ATM because I was a week away and=20
couldn't process patches, it would feel unfair to penalize other devs=20
because of that so for the series which have been around for awhile, I=20
still try to process them during this week, this one included).

My plan is to take this into for-next during this cycle.

We can always take a timeout and revert it during -rc phase if problems=20
appear because of it (and even after 7.2 release, if situation requires=20
it).

I'm not convinced testing pre rc1 really covers much when it comes to=20
platform drivers, those few people testing linux-next, as valuable as they=
=20
are, cannot really cover that much HW diversity.
