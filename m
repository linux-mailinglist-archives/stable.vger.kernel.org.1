Thanks for forwarding this!  I really can't escape comparing the
response from Rockchip support to the old funny story in which
a passenger on a plane asks a flight attendant where they are,
and the attendant responds that they're on a plane. :D

In other words, that's perfectly valid information that describes
what an industrial environment looks like, but it has nothing to
do with describing the specifics of the applications of RK3588J
in such environments.

Yes, AFAICT that's the only directly related difference in the
hard numbers provided by the RK3588 and RK3588J datasheets.

There's also the following document:
https://download.t-firefly.com/Spec/CoreBorads/iCore-3588Q_Specification_EN.pdf?v=1743061914

I've also been unable to find the RK3588M datasheet.  Regarding
the Firefly SoMs with different RK3588 variants, it does seem
that the RK3588M, i.e. the automotive variant, is capable of
reaching 2.0 GHz throughout its entire operating range.

Maybe the RK3588M datasheet will become publicly available at
some point, allowing us to learn a bit more about it.

We've exhausted all the available resources, so there actually
isn't much more to do anyway.
