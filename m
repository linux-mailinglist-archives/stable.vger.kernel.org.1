No. open_by_handle_at() is not supposed to let you bypass
non-executable directories.

Filesystems without a special export_operations::permission handler go thro=
ugh:

do_handle_open -> handle_to_path -> may_decode_fh

which requires that the caller has global CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH, or is
capable over the superblock, or is capable over the containing mount.

d_revalidate refreshes dentries, but it doesn't make anything about
the underlying inode atomic; and my understanding is that procfs wants
to avoid tying inodes to things like task_struct or mm_struct to avoid
keeping those objects alive unnecessarily.

I think d_revalidate would make sense if, for example, we wanted the
/proc/$pid/maps inode to hold a reference to the corresponding
mm_struct.

Hmm... the reason we got it wrong in the past is that we were using
cred_guard_mutex, which was held across stuff that can (indirectly)
wait for ptrace, right? Whereas nowadays we basically only have to
ensure that we don't block on userspace actions while holding the
exec_update_lock? Which still requires some care but should be less
problematic.

You mean the case where the EUID is different from RUID and/or SUID,
and userspace calls setresuid(current_euid, current_euid,
current_euid)?

I think I see your point - in this case, if P1 calls
setresuid(current_euid, current_euid, current_euid), fred would
afterwards be allowed to ptrace P1.

That feels to me like it is a bit weird, but probably not very
problematic because fred owns the file; P1 is already running code
owned by fred. Though fred can't necessarily actually change the file
contents, if the file is immutable or the mount is readonly or such.

I... think it is also rare for setuid binaries to call
setresuid(current_euid, current_euid, current_euid), since normally it
is desired that they keep the original RUID for stuff like
signal-sending permissions? But I might be wrong about that.

I agree that it would be nicer to get rid of that... I remember amluto
saying the same thing.

Lennart Poettering thinks that, too, and has added the sudo
replacement "run0" in systemd, which works by talking to systemd and
authenticating via polkit:
