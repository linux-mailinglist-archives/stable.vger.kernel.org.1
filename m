They can be dropped, yes, but it's easier to add the follow-on revert so
that all of the scripts out there don't keep resending the original
change as part of the "hey, you missed this patch!" sweeps that people
run.

So taking both of them is better, right?  That also ensures that Linus's
tree is fixed up, which is key for everyone involved.

For stuff that is "this should not be in the stable tree at all", we
always drop those easily, that's never a problem.
