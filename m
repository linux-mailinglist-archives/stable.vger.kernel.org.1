Sorry, but as these would only be in th 5.10.y release, and not in any
newer stable kernel, you would have a regression if you moved to a newer
stable kernel branch, right?

Because of that, no, I can't take this, nor should you want me to, as
you would have a regression if you upgraded, right?

I'll be glad to do so if we have backports for all relevant stable
kernels.

thanks,
