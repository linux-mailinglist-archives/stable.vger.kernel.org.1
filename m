uses protocol state flag HCI_UART_PROTO_READY to track lower level
transport type state, i don't think it is perfect.

for common files hci_serdev.c and hci_ldisc.c, as you saw, the purpose
of checking HCI_UART_PROTO_READY is to call protocol relevant
interfaces, moreover, these protocol relevant interfaces do not deal
with lower transport state. you maybe even notice below present function
within which lower level serdev is flushed before HCI_UART_PROTO_READY
is checked:

static int hci_uart_flush(struct hci_dev *hdev)
{
......
        /* Flush any pending characters in the driver and discipline. */
        serdev_device_write_flush(hu->serdev);

        if (test_bit(HCI_UART_PROTO_READY, &hu->flags))
                hu->proto->flush(hu);

        return 0;
}

in my opinion, that is why qca_serdev_shutdown() does not check
HCI_UART_PROTO_READY for later lower level serdev operations.

qca_serdev_shutdown() will never be called after case 2 as explained

above sequence should not correct as explained below.

serdev and its driver should also follow below generic device and driver
design.

1)
driver->shutdown() will be called during shut-down time at this time
driver->remove() should not have been called.

2)
driver->shutdown() is impossible to be called once driver->remove()
was called.

3) for serdev, driver->remove() does not trigger call of
driver->shutdown() since PM relevant poweroff is irrelevant with
driver->shutdown() and i also don't find any PM relevant interfaces will
call driver->shutdown().

i would like to explain issue B based on comments Zijun posted by public
as below:

issue B actually happens during reboot and let me look at these steps
boot -> enable BT -> disable BT -> reboot.

1) step boot will call driver->probe() to register hdev and the serdev
is opened after boot.

2) step enable will call hdev->open() and the serdev will still in open
state

3) step disable will call hdev->close() and the serdev will be closed
after hdev->close() for machine with config which results in
HCI_QUIRK_NON_PERSISTENT_SETUP is set.

4) step reboot will call qca_serdev_shutdown() which will flush and
write the serdev which are closed by above step disable, so cause the
UAF issue, namely, kernel crash issue.

so this issue is caused by commit B which close the serdev during
hdev->close().

driver->remove() even is not triggered during above steps.
