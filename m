commit 9dc162e22387080e2d06de708b89920c0e158c9a upstream.

The Focusrite Scarlett audio device does not behave correctly during
resumes. Below is what happens during every resume (captured with
Beagle 5000):

<Suspend>
<Resume>
<Reset>/<Chirp J>/<Tiny J>
<Reset/Target disconnected>
<High Speed>

The Scarlett disconnects and is enumerated again.

However from time to time it drops completely off the USB bus during
resume. Below is captured occurrence of such an event:

<Suspend>
<Resume>
<Reset>/<Chirp J>/<Tiny J>
<Reset>/<Chirp K>/<Tiny K>
<High Speed>
<Corrupted packet>
<Reset/Target disconnected>

To fix the condition a user has to unplug and plug the device again.

With USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME applied ("usbcore.quirks=1235:8211:b")
for the Scarlett audio device the issue still reproduces.

Applying USB_QUIRK_DISCONNECT_SUSPEND ("usbcore.quirks=1235:8211:m")
fixed the issue and the Scarlett audio device didn't drop off the USB
bus for ~5000 suspend/resume cycles where originally issue reproduced in
~100 or less suspend/resume cycles.
