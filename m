[ Upstream commit 102c8b26b54e363f85c4c86099ca049a0a76bb58 ]

A PCIe hotplug slot applies to the entire secondary bus. Thus, pciehp only
allocates a single hotplug_slot for the bridge to that bus. The existing
PCI slot, though, would only match to functions on device 0, meaning any
devices beyond that, e.g., ARI functions, are not matched to any slot even
though they share it. A slot reset will break all the missing devices
because the handling skips them.

For example, ARI devices with more than 8 functions fail because their
state is not properly handled, nor is the attached driver notified of the
reset. In the best case, the device will appear unresponsive to the driver,
resulting in unexpected errors. A worse possibility may panic the kernel if
in-flight transactions trigger hardware reported errors like this real
observation:

  GHES: Fatal hardware error but panic disabled
  Kernel panic - not syncing: GHES: Fatal hardware error

Allow a slot to be created to claim all devices on a bus, not just a
matching device. This is done by introducing a sentinel value, named
PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES, which then has the PCI slot match to any device on
the bus. This fixes slot resets for pciehp.

Since 0xff already has special meaning, the chosen value for this new
feature is 0xfe. This will not clash with any actual slot number since they
are limited to 5 bits.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me compile my final
analysis.

---

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: Subject Line**
- Subsystem: PCI (pciehp hotplug)
- Action verb: "Allow" - describes enabling a new behavior
- Summary: Enables PCIe hotplug slot to match ALL bus devices, not just
  device 0
- Record: [PCI/pciehp] [Allow] [bus-wide slot matching for ARI device
  reset handling]

**Step 1.2: Tags**
- Signed-off-by: Keith Busch <kbusch@kernel.org> (author, prolific PCI
  contributor)
- Signed-off-by: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com> (PCI subsystem
  maintainer)
- Reviewed-by: Dan Williams <dan.j.williams@intel.com> (Intel PCI/CXL
  expert)
- Link:
  https://patch.msgid.link/20260217160836.2709885-3-kbusch@meta.com
  (patch 3 of a series)
- No Fixes: tag, no Cc: stable, no Reported-by - all expected for
  autosel candidates
- Record: Strong author+reviewer pedigree. Accepted through PCI
  maintainer tree.

**Step 1.3: Commit Body**
- Bug: pciehp allocates a single hotplug_slot for the bridge, but only
  matches device 0. ARI devices with >8 functions have functions
  appearing to be on different PCI_SLOT() values. These are not matched
  to the slot.
- Symptom: Slot reset skips unmatched devices - drivers not notified,
  state not saved/restored. This causes hardware errors, device
  unresponsiveness, and **kernel panic** from fatal PCIe AER errors.
- Real observed failure: Hardware Error with `Kernel panic - not
  syncing: GHES: Fatal hardware error` shown for a vfio-pci device at
  0000:01:01.0 during reset of 0000:01:00.0.
- Record: Bug is kernel panic during slot reset of ARI devices. Root
  cause is slot matching only covers device 0.

**Step 1.4: Hidden Bug Fix Detection**
- Despite the "Allow" verb (sounds feature-like), this fixes a concrete
  kernel panic. The commit includes a full hardware error trace showing
  the panic.
- Record: This IS a bug fix, clearly demonstrated by the panic trace.

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

**Step 2.1: Inventory**
- `include/linux/pci.h`: +8 lines (define + comment), 1 line changed
  (struct comment)
- `drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_core.c`: 2 lines changed (0 ->
  PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES)
- `drivers/pci/slot.c`: +8 lines (new sysfs case), 3 conditionals
  changed, ~12 lines doc updates
- Total: ~20-25 functional lines, rest documentation. 3 files changed.
- Functions modified: `init_slot()`, `address_read_file()`,
  `pci_slot_release()`, `pci_dev_assign_slot()`, `pci_create_slot()`
- Record: Small-to-medium scope, well-contained to slot management code.

**Step 2.2: Code Flow Changes**
1. `pci.h`: Adds `PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES 0xfe` sentinel constant
2. `pciehp_core.c init_slot()`: Changes slot number from `0` to
   `PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES`
3. `slot.c pci_slot_release()`: Adds `slot->number ==
   PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES ||` check - ensures ALL bus devices get
   `dev->slot = NULL` on release
4. `slot.c pci_dev_assign_slot()`: Same pattern - ensures ALL bus
   devices get `dev->slot = slot` during assignment
5. `slot.c pci_create_slot()`: Same pattern - ensures ALL devices on bus
   get `dev->slot` at creation
6. `slot.c address_read_file()`: New sysfs case for PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES
   emitting `0` for device number (backward compatible)

**Step 2.3: Bug Mechanism**
- Category: Logic/correctness bug in slot matching
- What was broken: `PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn) == slot->number` only matches
  device 0. ARI functions >=8 have `PCI_SLOT(devfn) != 0`.
- How the fix works: The sentinel `PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES` makes all
  comparisons match any device on the bus.
- Impact chain: `pci_dev_assign_slot()` skips ARI devices -> `dev->slot
  == NULL` -> `pci_slot_lock/save/restore` skips them (checks
  `!dev->slot || dev->slot != slot`) -> state not saved during reset ->
  hardware errors -> kernel panic

**Step 2.4: Fix Quality**
- Obviously correct: Yes - the matching logic is straightforward
- Minimal: Mostly - introduces a new constant as mechanism, but the
  functional changes are small
- Regression risk: Very low - the new code path only triggers when
  `slot->number == PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES`, which only pciehp sets
- Record: High quality fix, well-reviewed, low regression risk.

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY

**Step 3.1: Blame**
- `slot.c` line 76 (`PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn) == slot->number`): from commit
  cef354db0d7a72 (2008)
- `slot.c` line 169 (pci_dev_assign_slot): from cef354db0d7a72 (2008)
- `pciehp_core.c` line 82 (passing `0`): from 774d446b0f9222 (2018),
  originally from even earlier
- The buggy slot matching logic has been present since 2008 - it exists
  in ALL stable trees.
- Record: Buggy code from 2008, present in all active stable trees.

**Step 3.2: No Fixes: tag to follow** - Expected for autosel candidates.

**Step 3.3: File History**
- Recent changes to slot.c include treewide allocator changes (non-
  conflicting) and minor hotplug cleanups
- The pci_slot_lock() fix (1f5e57c622b4d) is already in 7.0, which was a
  prerequisite from the same author
- Record: File has low recent churn. Prerequisite slot lock fix already
  present.

**Step 3.4: Author Assessment**
- Keith Busch is a major PCI/NVMe subsystem contributor at Meta
- Has 30+ commits to `drivers/pci/` in this tree, focusing on error
  recovery and reset handling
- Record: Author is a key subsystem expert.

**Step 3.5: Dependencies**
- This is patch 3 of a series (msgid ...-3). The v2 series had 4
  patches. Patches 1+2 from v2 are in 7.0 (trylock fix + slot lock fix).
  Patches 3+4 from v2 were NOT applied (they took a different approach:
  removing slot-specific lock/unlock).
- The Feb 17 series (v3?) evolved the approach. This patch introduces
  PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES instead of removing slot-specific functions.
- This patch is self-contained: it only modifies slot matching in slot.c
  and the init call in pciehp_core.c. The existing pci.c code
  (`dev->slot != slot` checks) works automatically once `dev->slot` is
  correctly assigned.
- Record: Self-contained, no additional dependencies beyond what's
  already in 7.0.

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST RESEARCH

**Step 4.1: Original Patch Discussion**
- b4 dig found the v2 series at
  https://patch.msgid.link/20260130165953.751063-3-kbusch@meta.com
- The v2 thread shows this was a 4-patch series: trylock fix, slot lock
  fix, remove slot-specific functions, make reset_subordinate hotplug
  safe
- The "Allow all bus devices" commit (Feb 17) is from a later revision
  that changed approach
- Dan Williams reviewed patches 3 and 4 of v2, providing feedback that
  led to the evolved approach
- Record: Series went through multiple revisions with review feedback
  incorporated.

**Step 4.2: Reviewers**
- Dan Williams (Intel, CXL/PCI expert) - Reviewed-by
- Bjorn Helgaas (PCI maintainer) - accepted and signed off
- Record: Key PCI maintainers reviewed and approved.

**Step 4.3: Bug Report**
- No external bug report link, but the commit message contains a real
  panic trace from production hardware
- The error shows vfio-pci resetting 0000:01:00.0, then device
  0000:01:01.0 (ARI function) triggering fatal hardware error
- Record: Real-world production failure documented in commit message.

**Step 4.4-4.5**: Lore site behind Anubis protection, but b4 dig
provided series information.

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1: Key Functions**
Modified: `init_slot()`, `address_read_file()`, `pci_slot_release()`,
`pci_dev_assign_slot()`, `pci_create_slot()`

**Step 5.2: Callers**
- `pci_dev_assign_slot()` called from `pci_setup_device()` in probe.c -
  called during EVERY device enumeration
- `pci_create_slot()` called from pciehp init and other hotplug drivers
- The reset path uses `dev->slot` pointer in: `pci_slot_resettable()`,
  `pci_slot_lock()`, `pci_slot_unlock()`, `pci_slot_trylock()`,
  `pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked()`, `pci_slot_restore_locked()`
- `pci_reset_bus()` is called from VFIO, error recovery, and other reset
  paths
- Record: Highly reachable code paths. Reset triggered from userspace
  via VFIO.

**Step 5.3-5.5**: The fix ensures all devices on a pciehp bus get
`dev->slot` assigned, which propagates to all existing slot iteration
functions without any changes to pci.c.

## PHASE 6: STABLE TREE ANALYSIS

**Step 6.1: Buggy Code in Stable**
- The slot matching code (`PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn) == slot->number`) exists
  since 2008 - present in ALL active stable trees
- pciehp passing `0` as slot_nr exists since at least 2018 (commit
  774d446b0f9222)
- Record: Bug exists in all stable trees from 5.x through 7.0.

**Step 6.2: Backport Complications**
- The 7.0 tree has some treewide refactoring (kmalloc -> kmalloc_obj)
  that might cause minor context conflicts
- The core changes should apply cleanly with minor adjustments
- Record: Minor conflicts possible, but straightforward to resolve.

**Step 6.3: No related fixes already in stable for this specific
issue.**

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM CONTEXT

**Step 7.1: Subsystem**
- PCI core / pciehp - CORE subsystem
- Affects all systems with PCIe hotplug and ARI-capable devices
- Common in: VFIO/SR-IOV virtualization, datacenter hardware
- Record: [PCI/hotplug] [CORE/IMPORTANT]

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK

**Step 8.1: Affected Users**
- Users with PCIe ARI devices (multi-function devices with >8 functions)
  undergoing slot reset
- Common in VFIO/SR-IOV scenarios in datacenters and virtualization
- Record: Important user population (datacenter, virtualization)

**Step 8.2: Trigger Conditions**
- Triggered by slot reset (VFIO reset, error recovery, hotplug events)
- Can be triggered from userspace via VFIO
- The VFIO use case is common in production
- Record: Realistic trigger, reachable from userspace

**Step 8.3: Failure Mode**
- Kernel panic from fatal hardware error (GHES)
- Device unresponsiveness, unexpected driver errors
- Record: CRITICAL severity - kernel panic

**Step 8.4: Risk-Benefit**
- BENEFIT: Very high - prevents kernel panic in production VFIO/ARI
  scenarios
- RISK: Low - changes are well-contained, only affect slots with
  PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES, backward compatible sysfs output
- Record: Strong benefit/risk ratio

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Step 9.1: Evidence Summary**
FOR backporting:
- Fixes documented kernel panic with real hardware error trace
- Affects production VFIO/SR-IOV users with ARI devices
- Author is key PCI contributor, reviewed by Dan Williams, accepted by
  Bjorn Helgaas
- Self-contained fix, no dependencies on other unmerged patches
- Low regression risk - new code path only for PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES
  slots
- Buggy code present since 2008 - affects all stable trees
- The sysfs change preserves backward compatibility

AGAINST backporting:
- Introduces new `PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES` constant (new kernel-internal
  API)
- Adds new semantics to `pci_create_slot()` (bus-wide slots)
- Part of a multi-patch series (patch 3), though self-contained
- Not purely surgical - includes documentation and sysfs behavior
  changes
- No Fixes: tag (expected for autosel)

**Step 9.2: Stable Rules Checklist**
1. Obviously correct and tested? YES - reviewed by Dan Williams,
   accepted by Bjorn Helgaas
2. Fixes a real bug? YES - kernel panic during ARI device slot reset
3. Important issue? YES - kernel panic (CRITICAL severity)
4. Small and contained? YES (borderline) - ~25 functional lines, 3
   files, well-contained scope
5. No new features/APIs? BORDERLINE - `PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES` is new but
   is mechanism for bug fix, not a user-facing feature
6. Can apply to stable? YES with possible minor context adjustments

**Step 9.3: Exception Categories**
- This is a hardware workaround/fix category - fixing slot reset to
  properly handle ARI devices

**Step 9.4: Decision**
The kernel panic severity, production impact (VFIO/ARI), strong
authorship/review, self-contained nature, and backward compatibility
outweigh the concern about the new internal constant. The
`PCI_SLOT_ALL_DEVICES` define is the minimal mechanism needed to fix
this bug correctly.

- [Phase 6] Buggy code exists in all stable trees (code from 2008/2018)
- [Phase 6] Minor context conflicts possible from treewide refactoring
- [Phase 8] Failure mode: kernel panic from GHES fatal hardware error -
  severity CRITICAL
- UNVERIFIED: Could not access lore.kernel.org directly due to Anubis
  protection for detailed discussion review
- UNVERIFIED: Exact series composition for the v3 (Feb 17) submission
  beyond patch 3
