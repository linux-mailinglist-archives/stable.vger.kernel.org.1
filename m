Well, but these are *directories*. So no hardlinks possible ;) I agree with
regular files we'd have to be more careful but then VFS would take care of
the locking anyway. I'm still convinced VFS should be taking care of
locking of directories as well but Al disagreed [1] and wants only filesystems
that need this to handle the directory locking.

Right, so this case indeed looks possible and I didn't think about it.
Thanks for spotting this! Let me try to persuade Al again to do the
necessary locking in VFS as it is getting really hairy and needs VFS
changes anyway.
