Hey Andrii,

np, thanks for taking a look!

Right, this is the piece of the information that I was missing. It now
makes much more sense.

Many thanks for the patch! Looking at it, I got pretty close during my
attempts, I only missed the ZERO trick, which is obviously crucial. I
was worried I'll have to rewrite the logic much more to get rid of the
concrete carry-over state but this is really neat.

I'm wondering if we could teach the verifier to figure out that it's
tracking a value too precisely in an iterator-based loop and convert it
to a range (sort of a "widening" operation). But I guess that this part
is going to be changed quite a bit with the upcoming verifier change
that Alexei is working on.

I'll take your change and send v2 of the patch (with a fall back to
standard for loop to keep backwards compatibility).

Thanks again!
Viktor
