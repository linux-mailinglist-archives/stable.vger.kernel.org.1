I think the relationships are probably a bit loser than "fixes the same
commit", could also be things like "these two patches fix commits in the
same original series". Actually something that would be ideal to just
have an LLM vet, with some basic rules, honed down the line? Stable is
important to me, but it does feel a bit fast and lose sometimes, some
more process (and particularly automated process) might not be a bad
idea?

Right, but they were sent in for a specific tree, and all dependencies
were either in that tree already, or part of the series. That's
different than the stable side.

While that is probably true, I also think it's unavoidable to have more
stable going patches post -rc1, as lots of late fixes for eg 7.1 and
earlier end up being staged for 7.2 and hence end up as part of the
bigger pile from maintainers. Early in the -rc series I'm more liberal
in what I apply for the current version, later in the -rc series there's
a higher likelihood that fixes that should go to stable does end up in
my next branch and go in over the merge window. I bet this is pretty
common, as we expect upstream to calm down as we get near final.
