I understand it's scary. To make a new file in the first place.

But I was a bit vague of what I wanted, and I'm sorry.

So, the reason why I'd suggest a new file, is because if any subsystem
Theoretically bypasses sys_info to log a lockup, this completely misses
the filter and duplicates the dump

My file would act as a generic lockless state machine that any
subsystem can update regardless of how they dump logs.

If you have any questions, feel absolutely free to ask! :)

Discussion is a way to make everyone happy!

Thanks!
