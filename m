Adding Alex & Christian as they might be able to shed light on the amdgpu=
=20
side, but I think the problem still starts from=20
pci_reassign_bridge_resources().

I think that the bogosity starts within pci_reassign_bridge_resources().
I've very recently come to realize the entire BAR resize operation is=20
quite fragile as is and can fail to restore the original BARs as they were=
=20
when the resize fails (even if it tries to restore things as they were). To=
=20
fix that, I'll likely need to rework the entire structure of the resize=20
related functions so that the saved list can hold resources beyond just=20
the bridge windows that were released. I plan to eventually look at it but=
=20
the rebar max size thing seems way more urgent than this atm.

It also looks pci_reassign_bridge_resources() can leave resources in=20
non-resetted state for unassigned resources such as in this case=20
(the non-resize side of the fitting algorithm resets resources that it=20
failed to assign). For such resources, also IORESOURCE_UNSET gets=20
overwritten by restore_dev_resource() which is even worse. My guess is=20
that something in amdgpu assumes that, e.g., non-zero resource len implies=
=20
the resource is assigned, or it could be that this IORESOURCE_UNSET=20
problem make the amdgpu checks for it to not work as intended.

While I cannot pinpoint what ultimately causes the crash within amdgpu, it=
=20
seems that some code there takes pci_resource_start/len() without checking
first if the resource is assigned (admittedly, that check could be=20
somewhere else in the call chain, I only grepped for -A20 -B20 'resource'=
=20
which had lots of noise to comb through, using 'pci_resource' too should=20
find the interesting bits I think).

I'd actually want to add pci_resource_assigned() which checks only=20
res->parent as that seems the most robust check to tell if the resource=20
has been truly assigned. Endpoint drivers should then check a resource=20
with pci_resource_assigned() before using other resource getters on it.

I could say much more about how I think IORESOURCE_UNSET is entirely=20
redundant information and should be just dropped for simplicity's sake=20
(and current flags handling likely has many many corner cases which the=20
->parent check is entirely immune to) but it'd add to the length of an=20
already long reply. :-)

I'm sorry I don't know the answer, the amdgpu code is too unfamiliar=20
territory, maybe Alex or Christian has some idea and can pinpoint us to=20
what to look at.
