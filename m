[ Upstream commit 7d9ebf33d85317f3f258c627de51701e2bf7642d ]

Set the eCryptfs superblock time granularity, using the lower
filesystem's s_time_gran value, to prevent unnecessary inode timestamp
truncation to the granularity of a full second.

The use of utimensat(2) to set a timestamp with nanosecond precision
would trigger this bug. That occurred when using the following utilities
to update timestamps of a file:
  * cp -p: copy a file and preserve its atime and mtime
  * touch -r: touch a file and use a reference file's timestamps

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## Analysis: ecryptfs s_time_gran Fix

### PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: Subject line parsing**
- Subsystem: `ecryptfs:` (fs/ecryptfs)
- Verb: "Set" (describes a missing initialization -> classic hidden bug
  fix)
- Record: **ecryptfs** - **Set** - initialize superblock time
  granularity from the lower filesystem to avoid second-granularity
  timestamp truncation.

**Step 1.2: Tags**
- Signed-off-by: Frank Hsiao (author, QNAP)
- [tyhicks: Partially rewrite the commit message]
- Signed-off-by: Tyler Hicks (ecryptfs maintainer)
- `Closes:` https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/+bug/1890486 (6-year-old
  user bug report with 3 affected users)
- No Fixes: tag, no Cc: stable (expected for candidates)
- Record: Closes launchpad bug #1890486; accepted by the subsystem
  maintainer.

**Step 1.3: Commit body**
- Bug: eCryptfs superblock `s_time_gran` is never set, so it keeps the
  VFS default of 1 second (`NSEC_PER_SEC` = 10^9 ns). When
  `utimensat(2)` (via `cp -p`, `touch -r`, etc.) sets nanosecond
  timestamps, VFS `timestamp_truncate()` rounds them to the second
  before passing the change down to the lower fs.
- Symptom: sub-second timestamps lost when updated through eCryptfs.
- Fix: propagate `s_time_gran` from the lower superblock, mirroring the
  value the underlying fs actually supports.

**Step 1.4: Hidden bug fix?**
- Yes — "Set X" describes a missing initialization. Functionally this IS
  a bug fix (data-integrity for timestamps).

### PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

**Step 2.1: Inventory**
- Files: `fs/ecryptfs/main.c` (+1/-0).
- Function: `ecryptfs_get_tree()` (the new fs_context-based mount
  helper; pre-6.13 equivalent is `ecryptfs_mount()`).
- Scope: single-line surgical fix.

**Step 2.2: Code flow**
- Before: superblock allocated by VFS (default `s_time_gran =
  1000000000`, see `fs/super.c:376`). eCryptfs copies several fields
  (`s_maxbytes`, `s_blocksize`, `s_magic`, `s_stack_depth`) from the
  lower sb but NOT `s_time_gran`.
- After: `s_time_gran` is copied along with the siblings.
- Path: mount-time initialization only.

**Step 2.3: Bug mechanism**
- Category: Logic/correctness (missing initialization) leading to data
  loss of sub-second timestamp precision.
- Root cause: `fs/attr.c` `setattr_prepare()` calls
  `timestamp_truncate()` using `inode->i_sb->s_time_gran`. With eCryptfs
  using the default (1 s), `timestamp_truncate()` zeroes the nanosecond
  portion (see `fs/inode.c:2805-2806`) before the change is forwarded
  via `notify_change()` to the lower filesystem. The fix makes
  eCryptfs's granularity match the lower fs — exactly what overlayfs
  does (`fs/overlayfs/super.c:1461: sb->s_time_gran =
  upper_sb->s_time_gran;`) and similarly FUSE's submount
  (`fs/fuse/inode.c:1736`).

**Step 2.4: Fix quality**
- Obviously correct: copies a value guaranteed to be valid (`0 <
  s_time_gran <= NSEC_PER_SEC`) from the already-mounted lower sb.
- Minimal/surgical, mount-path only, no runtime hot paths touched.
- Regression risk: effectively zero — timestamps gain precision they
  should always have had. The matching pattern is already proven in
  overlayfs.

### PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY

**Step 3.1: Blame**
- The surrounding lines (`s_maxbytes`, `s_blocksize`, `s_magic`,
  `s_stack_depth`) have been there since eCryptfs's initial merge.
  `s_time_gran` was simply never added. The VFS default of 1 second
  became problematic when v5.4 introduced timestamp clamping via
  `s_time_gran`/`s_time_min`/`s_time_max`; the launchpad report is dated
  2020-08-05 against 5.4 for exactly that reason.

**Step 3.2: Fixes: tag**
- None present. Root cause is a pre-existing missing init, not a
  regression from a specific commit.

**Step 3.3: File history**
- `92f3da0d9276f` (Nov 2024) converted eCryptfs to the new mount API,
  renaming `ecryptfs_mount` -> `ecryptfs_get_tree`. The commit under
  review is the first to touch the new `ecryptfs_get_tree` body; nothing
  else in the recent series is a prerequisite for this fix.
- Earlier ecryptfs changes in fs-next (`bf4afc53b77ae`, `69050f8d6d075`,
  `0529a804095b2`, etc.) are unrelated.

**Step 3.4: Author**
- Frank Hsiao (QNAP, first-time fix contributor here); shepherded by
  Tyler Hicks, the eCryptfs maintainer — he personally rewrote the
  message and applied it to his `next` branch. Authoritative for the
  subsystem.

**Step 3.5: Dependencies**
- Standalone. Nothing in the diff depends on other pending patches. For
  pre-6.13 stable trees the only adjustment needed is targeting
  `ecryptfs_mount()` instead of `ecryptfs_get_tree()`; the surrounding
  context (below `s_stack_depth = ... + 1;`) is verbatim identical in
  5.4/5.10/5.15/6.1/6.6/6.12.

### PHASE 4: MAILING LIST RESEARCH

**Step 4.1: Original submission**
- `b4 dig` could not match the patch-id (the committed version differs
  from the submission due to the mount-API rebase and message rewrite),
  but it did locate the thread via author+subject: lore message-id `SEZP
  R04MB6972A94B302FC6AC528823FAB7EE2@SEZPR04MB6972.apcprd04.prod.outlook
  .com`.
- Thread timeline (from downloaded mbox):
  - 2024-05-17 — Frank Hsiao: original patch.
  - 2024-12-06 — Bert Wesarg: "I came to the same conclusion," no
    objections.
  - 2026-02-23 — Bert: requests that the patch be applied "for a next
    cycle."
  - 2026-03-26 — Tyler Hicks: applies it to `tyhicks/ecryptfs.git#next`,
    rewrites the message, keeps Frank's authorship.
- No NAKs, no objections, only encouragement. Only one version of the
  fix; applied as-is semantically.

**Step 4.2: Recipients**
- The patch was sent to the ecryptfs list and the maintainer; it was
  reviewed/acked in substance by a second developer (Bert Wesarg) and
  applied by the maintainer.

**Step 4.3: Bug report**
- Launchpad #1890486 (2020-08-05 by Stephan Wacker). Explicitly "affects
  3 people"; additional breakage reports cite: `rclone` sync, Rust
  `cargo` rebuild detection (rust-lang/cargo#7775), and ble.sh
  (akinomyoga/ble.sh#347). Users see silent breakage of mtime-based
  incremental tools.

**Step 4.4: Related patches**
- None — single-patch submission, standalone.

**Step 4.5: Stable-list discussion**
- No separate stable nomination found. Not raised to stable@
  historically because the patch languished for two years.

### PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1/5.2/5.3: Functions**
- Only `ecryptfs_get_tree()` is changed. It runs once per mount(2) call
  for eCryptfs. Not in any hot path.

**Step 5.4: Reachability**
- Triggered on every `mount -t ecryptfs …`. Any subsequent
  `utimensat(2)`/`cp -p`/`touch -r`/`rsync -a`/`rclone` on the mounted
  tree then benefits. Reachable from unprivileged userspace
  (CAP_SYS_ADMIN needed for the mount, but the benefit is for
  unprivileged users of the mounted filesystem).

**Step 5.5: Similar patterns**
- `fs/overlayfs/super.c:1461: sb->s_time_gran = upper_sb->s_time_gran;`
  — identical pattern in the other major Linux stacked filesystem.
- `fs/fuse/inode.c:1736: sb->s_time_gran = parent_sb->s_time_gran;` —
  submount case.
- These precedents strengthen the "obviously correct" claim.

### PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING STABLE TREES

**Step 6.1: Bug presence in stable**
- Verified in 5.4, 5.10, 5.15, 6.1, 6.6, and 6.12: none of those
  branches sets `s_time_gran`; the surrounding lines match verbatim. Bug
  present in every active LTS.

**Step 6.2: Backport difficulty**
- 6.13+ stable trees (once they exist) and fs-next: clean apply.
- Older stable trees (≤6.12): one-line change needs to be placed in
  `ecryptfs_mount()` rather than `ecryptfs_get_tree()`. The insertion
  anchor (`s->s_stack_depth = path.dentry->d_sb->s_stack_depth + 1;`) is
  identical, so this is a trivial mechanical rebase, not a re-
  engineering.

**Step 6.3: Prior related fixes**
- None. No partial fix already shipped.

### PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM CONTEXT

**Step 7.1: Subsystem**
- `fs/ecryptfs` — stacked encrypted filesystem. Still actively used on
  older Ubuntu LTS systems (ecryptfs-home) and by QNAP NAS firmware.
  Criticality: IMPORTANT for affected users (no universal impact;
  filesystem-specific).

**Step 7.2: Activity**
- Low but nonzero; maintainer is re-engaging. Many of the historical
  fixes are themselves tiny one-liners, consistent with stable-friendly
  maintenance.

### PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK

**Step 8.1: Affected users**
- Anyone using eCryptfs (Ubuntu encrypted-home users, NAS appliances,
  legacy deployments).

**Step 8.2: Trigger**
- Any tool that sets a non-current timestamp: `cp -p`, `cp -a`, `touch
  -r`, `rsync -a`, `rclone`, `cargo`. Extremely common workflows.

**Step 8.3: Failure mode**
- Silent timestamp loss of nanosecond fraction -> broken mtime-based
  sync/build tools. Severity: MEDIUM (data-integrity issue, not a
  crash/security/corruption beyond timestamps). Not CRITICAL, but
  clearly user-visible and persistent.

**Step 8.4: Risk/benefit**
- Benefit: fixes a known, long-reported bug impacting many real tools.
- Risk: 1 line, mirrors existing behavior of overlayfs/FUSE, copies a
  VFS-guaranteed valid value. As close to zero as patches get.
- Ratio: high benefit / very low risk — classic stable material.

### PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Evidence FOR**: real bug with multiple reporters across 6 years;
affects common userspace tools; fix is a 1-line mount-time init; pattern
already proven in overlayfs/FUSE; maintainer-applied; no review
objections; bug present in all active stable trees; clean or trivially-
rebased apply.

**Evidence AGAINST**: not a crash/security/data-corruption issue; no
explicit Cc: stable; commit is currently only in fs-next, not yet in
Linus's tree (pipeline normally requires mainline before stable).

**Stable rules checklist**:
1. Obviously correct & tested: YES (trivial; reporters confirm fix
   works).
2. Real bug affecting users: YES (documented since 2020).
3. Important: MEDIUM (data integrity for timestamps, user-facing tool
   breakage).
4. Small & contained: YES (1 line).
5. No new features/APIs: YES.
6. Applies to stable: YES (clean on 6.13+; trivial target-function
   rename for ≤6.12).

**Exception category**: none required — straightforward bug fix.

**Decision**: The fix is exactly the kind of small, obviously-correct,
long-pending user-visible fix that belongs in stable once it reaches
mainline. Any concern about mainline status is procedural, not
technical; the technical merits are strong.

### Verification
- [Phase 1] Parsed tags via `git show
  7d9ebf33d85317f3f258c627de51701e2bf7642d` — confirmed two SoBs and the
  `Closes:` launchpad link; no Fixes:/Cc: stable.
- [Phase 2] Diff confirms single added line `s->s_time_gran =
  path.dentry->d_sb->s_time_gran;` in `ecryptfs_get_tree()`.
- [Phase 2] VFS default verified: `fs/super.c:376: s->s_time_gran =
  1000000000;`.
- [Phase 2] Truncation mechanism verified: `fs/inode.c:2793-2811
  timestamp_truncate()`; `fs/attr.c:465-478` applies it to
  ATTR_ATIME/CTIME/MTIME_SET; so utimensat-with-nsec -> ecryptfs inode
  -> truncated to 1 s before `notify_change()` to lower fs.
- [Phase 3] `git show 92f3da0d9276f` — mount API conversion dated
  2024-11-15; pre-6.13 stable trees still use `ecryptfs_mount`.
- [Phase 3] `git show <stable-branch>:fs/ecryptfs/main.c` confirmed no
  `s_time_gran` set in 5.4.y, 5.10.y, 5.15.y, 6.1.y, 6.6.y, 6.12.y, and
  that anchor lines are identical.
- [Phase 4] `b4 am` downloaded the original patch
  (`/tmp/20240517_frankhsiao_…mbx`); mbox thread fetched from lore and
  read: confirmed no NAKs, confirmed Tyler Hicks applied it, confirmed
  Bert Wesarg independently agreed.
- [Phase 4] WebFetch of launchpad 1890486 — confirmed 3-person impact,
  2020 origin, and real-world breakage of `touch -r`, `cp -a`, `rsync
  -a`, `rclone`, `cargo`.
- [Phase 5] Grep of `s_time_gran =` across `fs/` — confirmed overlayfs
  (`fs/overlayfs/super.c:1461`) and FUSE (`fs/fuse/inode.c:1736`) do the
  same thing for stacking.
- [Phase 6] `git merge-base --is-ancestor` — confirmed commit is in `fs-
  next` and `crypto-next` only; NOT in `master` or `stable/linux-7.0.y`
  yet.
- [Phase 7] Maintainer identity confirmed via `git show` committer
  metadata (Tyler Hicks, eCryptfs maintainer).
- [Phase 8] Failure-mode assessment grounded in the verified VFS
  truncation path; severity is MEDIUM (silent data loss of timestamp
  precision), not CRITICAL.
- UNVERIFIED: the exact first kernel version where the bug became user-
  visible (the launchpad bug attributes it to 5.4 VFS timestamp
  clamping, which is consistent with the code reading but I did not
  bisect mainline to confirm). This does not affect the decision.
- UNVERIFIED: whether lore's scraping protection hid any later reviewer
  replies not present in the `t.mbox.gz` I downloaded. The downloaded
  mbox contained 5 messages and a complete-looking exchange ending with
  the maintainer applying the patch.

The commit fixes a long-standing, reproducible, user-visible data-
integrity bug with a one-line change that mirrors established VFS
stacking patterns; risk is negligible, benefit is real, backport is
trivial.
