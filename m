6.1-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

[ Upstream commit d02e382cef06cc73561dd32dfdc171c00dcc416d ]

Tearing down timers which have circular dependencies to other
functionality, e.g. workqueues, where the timer can schedule work and work
can arm timers, is not trivial.

In those cases it is desired to shutdown the timer in a way which prevents
rearming of the timer. The mechanism to do so is to set timer->function to
NULL and use this as an indicator for the timer arming functions to ignore
the (re)arm request.

In preparation for that replace the warnings in the relevant code paths
with checks for timer->function == NULL. If the pointer is NULL, then
discard the rearm request silently.

Add debug_assert_init() instead of the WARN_ON_ONCE(!timer->function)
checks so that debug objects can warn about non-initialized timers.

The warning of debug objects does not warn if timer->function == NULL.  It
warns when timer was not initialized using timer_setup[_on_stack]() or via
DEFINE_TIMER(). If developers fail to enable debug objects and then waste
lots of time to figure out why their non-initialized timer is not firing,
they deserve it. Same for initializing a timer with a NULL function.
