[ Upstream commit 5c1806c41ce0a0110db5dd4c483cf2dc28b3ddf0 ]

This is a false positive data race between a seqcount latch writer and a reader
accessing stale data. Since its introduction, KCSAN has never understood the
seqcount_latch interface (due to being unannotated).

Unlike the regular seqlock interface, the seqcount_latch interface for latch
writers never has had a well-defined critical section, making it difficult to
teach tooling where the critical section starts and ends.

Introduce an instrumentable (non-raw) seqcount_latch interface, with
which we can clearly denote writer critical sections. This both helps
readability and tooling like KCSAN to understand when the writer is done
updating all latch copies.

Fixes: 88ecd153be95 ("seqlock, kcsan: Add annotations for KCSAN")
