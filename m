Thank you, that is very helpful, for a couple of reasons.

"Machine 2" is a new build, so if (as it sounds) the motherboard has a 
hardware problem, then I need to
look into returning it.

BTW- it seems I spoke too soon about the USB stick suppressing the 
error. After a couple of reboots with
it in place the problem re-occurred. It does seem that connecting a hub 
(switch) is theÂ  only way
to reliably stop the error. The switch has a bunch of wiring connected 
to USB peripherals and other
machines. I would have guessed that might make the likelihood of picking 
up electrical noise
actually worse, but that seems not to be the case here.

"Machine 1" is several years old, it's actually the guts of the same PC 
that was upgraded to make M/c 2.
It's not usable, or sellable, with this performance hit happening. I 
have tried all the external USB ports
on this machine and not found the failing controller, my guess is it's 
going to be one that supports
some of the on-board USB headers.

I had been looking on the web for a way to shut down the problem port, 
or worst case the whole hub,
however all the Linux examples I found worked by either-

a) Preventing the loading of the driver for the chipset, by type. 
However that would kill all ports supported by
 Â Â Â  the same type of controller, and this motherboardÂ has multiple 
controllers of the same type onboard.

b) Shutting down a port by searching for the connected device 
identifier. However in these cases there
 Â Â Â  _are_ no connected devlces, the fault happens when the controller 
is not connected to anything.

Hopefully the command you recommended will do the trick, I will let you 
know.

Would I be correct in thinking this would need to be run at every boot, 
some time after device enumeration,
or would it need to be run after every re-enumeration of devices after a 
USB device is connected /
disconnected? Not sure how to achieve that.

IÂ very much appreciate your help in identifying the fault. Thank you.
