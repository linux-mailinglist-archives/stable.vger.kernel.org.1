The LLM got it right here. This won't work for 6.6.y and 6.12.y. The check
for dynamically allocated minors is different on those versions.

For 6.12 and 6.6, this should be:

	if (misc->minor > MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR ||
	    (misc->minor < DYNAMIC_MINORS && misc->minor >= 15))
		misc->minor = MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR;

Or pick 31b636d2c416 ("char: misc: restrict the dynamic range to exclude
reserved minors"), or just drop this from 6.6 and 6.12.
