LOL, I'll remember that.

The situation I have in mind is a bit harder to blame on userspace,
though. Supposing that the whole VM was set up correctly, multiple vCPUs
entering KVM_RUN concurrently could cause this race and have 'unexpected'
MMIO exits go out to userspace.

       vgic_register_dist_iodev()

A small but stupid window to race with.

Pushing more of the initialization complexity into userspace feels like
the right thing. Since we clearly have no idea what we're doing :)

Throwing it back at userspace would be nice, but unfortunately for ABI I
think we need to block/spin vCPUs in the kernel til the VM is in fully
working condition. A fragile userspace could explode for a 'spurious'
EAGAIN/EINTR where there wasn't one before.
