Yes, I realize that. I had hoped that by way of the Fixes: tag, people 
would be able to relate that comment to the correct commit. Might be a 
little circuitous ...

Does lore pick up related patches through the In-Reply-To header? In 
that case it would be easiest for me to to put this comment in a cover 
letter to the bugfix patch.

No, it was incorrect (though valid).

On a 2 TB disk, a partition of 1.3 TB at the end of the disk (but not 
extending to the very end!) would trigger a overflow in the size 
calculation:

sda: p4 size 18446744071956107760 extends beyond EOD,

That's only noted somewhere inside put_partition. The effective 
partition size seen by the kernel and user tools is then that of a 
partition extending to EOD (in Christian's case a full 8 GB more than 
recorded in the partition table).

mkfs used what the old kernel code gave as partition size. That did 
'seem' correct at that time, but after the overflow fixes (which prevent 
other partition miscalculations, which in Martin's case caused 
partitions to overlap), the partitions size is actually correct and 
smaller than the filesystem size.

I have a hunch I don't explain myself very well.

Yes, that's the easiest way to do it, but we don't yet know if gparted 
(for example) does allow to do that. Mucking around with hexedit (which 
is what I used to verify this change gives identical partition sizes for 
old and new kernels) isn't to everyone's taste.

I haven't looked at amiga-fdisk - that one might be easiest to fix.

Cheers,
