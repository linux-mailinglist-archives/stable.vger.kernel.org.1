Currently, the driver don't support hot-plug.

I presumed the remove in suspend is not actually a valid use-case, but with this 
scenario, if that happens, the device still remains attached in the software 
data structures. After this sequence:
1/ suspend
2/ disconnect an I3C device
3/ resume
4/ suspend
5/ re-connect the I3C devices
6/ resume

the reconnected I3C device works again after step 6 (according to my testing).

Waking up may happen slowly, indeed. So, I presume this is a valid use case.

Now, I have few question (if my I3C understanding is right):

I noticed none of the I3C drivers are taking care of the use case where the bus 
is fully populated after resume (and we are after a resume with power lost, for 
both the controller and the devices). That looks a bit tricky scenario to cover, 
to be honest, as all the drivers check for a free slot in ->attach_i3c_dev(), 
and, for a fully populated bus, that will not update the newly assigned 
addresses in the subsystem data structure.

If the ->attach_i3c_dev() called though the i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked() 
fails then nothing is continued so, the device address changes are not 
propagated in all the software data structures.

In case we re-use the DATBAS() register values as proposed in this patch, we 
have the changes that the driver software data caches (i3c->addrs[].addr) and 
the subsystem I3C devices addresses to match. But, that may not be true all the 
time.

If we re-assign new addresses to i3c->addrs[].addr in the DAA API, then write 
those values to DATBAS() registers, but the bus is fully populated, or no new 
devices are discovered as the indices remains the same, then, since we execute 
i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked() only for the newly attached devices, then the 
subsystem and the driver addresses don't match anymore. I couldn't found a 
global API similar to i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked() to work for removing 
devices and re-attaching at resume, for such scenario. I'm not sure that's good 
to do, though. If we call i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked() unconditionally, then 
it will still not work on a full previously occupied bus.

If I'm not wrong with all these, could you please let me know how would you 
consider covering this scenario? This is what I've tried to address with the 
approach in this patch. I currently don't have a testing setup for this, I only 
simulated it by setting i3c->free_pos = 0 before calling i3c_master_do_daa_ext().

Would the usage of i3c_device_do_setdasa() being called from a master driver be 
something acceptable? Though, I currently haven't played around with it.

As I don't have a real setup to test this, would it be OK to restore the 
approach in this patch as proposed in v1?

Please let me know. Thank you!

I wasn't aware of the notifier used to add I2C devices to the bus.

That is a previously existing problem that may happen. However, I am not sure 
how we should deal with the case when this is called after resume, on a fully 
populated bus.

Frank, I3C maintainers, should we cover this case for now? Do you have some 
hints on how to go forward with it?

That may have happen even previously if the interrupts were configured as wakeup 
sources. However, at this point, all the clients should be suspended and thus, 
they shouldn't generate interrupts.
