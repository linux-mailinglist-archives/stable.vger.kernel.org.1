commit a847234e24d03d01a9566d1d9dcce018cc018d67 upstream.

This reverts commit d6af2ed29c7c1c311b96dac989dcb991e90ee195.

The statement "the hv_pci_bus_exit() call releases structures of all its
child devices" in commit d6af2ed29c7c is not true: in the path
hv_pci_probe() -> hv_pci_enter_d0() -> hv_pci_bus_exit(hdev, true): the
parameter "keep_devs" is true, so hv_pci_bus_exit() does *not* release the
child "struct hv_pci_dev *hpdev" that is created earlier in
pci_devices_present_work() -> new_pcichild_device().

The commit d6af2ed29c7c was originally made in July 2020 for RHEL 7.7,
where the old version of hv_pci_bus_exit() was used; when the commit was
rebased and merged into the upstream, people didn't notice that it's
not really necessary. The commit itself doesn't cause any issue, but it
makes hv_pci_probe() more complicated. Revert it to facilitate some
upcoming changes to hv_pci_probe().
