[ Upstream commit 571c1ea91a73db56bd94054fabecd0f070dc90db ]

If a console printer is interrupted during panic, it will never
be able to reacquire ownership in order to perform and cleanup.
That in itself is not a problem, since the non-panic CPU will
simply quiesce in an endless loop within nbcon_reacquire_nobuf().

However, in this state, platforms that do not support a true NMI
to interrupt the quiesced CPU will not be able to shutdown that
CPU from within panic(). This then causes problems for such as
being unable to load and run a kdump kernel.

Fix this by allowing non-panic CPUs to reacquire ownership using
a direct acquire. Then the non-panic CPUs can successfullyl exit
the nbcon_reacquire_nobuf() loop and the console driver can
perform any necessary cleanup. But more importantly, the CPU is
no longer quiesced and is free to process any interrupts
necessary for panic() to shutdown the CPU.

All other forms of acquire are still not allowed for non-panic
CPUs since it is safer to have them avoid gaining console
ownership that is not strictly necessary.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

**Backport Status: YES**

This commit should be backported to stable kernel trees for the
following reasons:

## Bug Fix for Critical System Functionality

1. **Fixes a real bug affecting kdump functionality**: The commit
   addresses a specific problem where platforms without true NMI support
   cannot properly shutdown CPUs during panic, preventing kdump kernels
   from loading. This is a critical debugging and recovery feature that
   many production systems rely on.

2. **Clear regression/breakage scenario**: The commit message clearly
   describes how the current behavior causes non-panic CPUs to get stuck
   in an endless loop in `nbcon_reacquire_nobuf()`, preventing proper
   CPU shutdown during panic. This is a functional regression that
   affects system reliability.

## Safe and Contained Fix

3. **Minimal and targeted change**: The fix is confined to the nbcon
   (new console) subsystem, specifically modifying only the acquire
   logic to allow reacquire during panic. The diff shows only 41
   insertions and 22 deletions, mostly adding a `is_reacquire` parameter
   to existing functions.

4. **No architectural changes**: The commit doesn't introduce new
   features or change the fundamental design. It merely adjusts the
   existing acquire logic to handle a specific edge case during panic.

5. **Conservative approach**: The fix maintains safety by:
   - Only allowing direct reacquire for non-panic CPUs (not all acquire
     types)
   - Preserving the check for `unsafe_takeover` state
   - Keeping all other panic-time restrictions in place

## Well-Tested and Reviewed

6. **Proper testing and review**: The commit has been:
   - Reported by Michael Kelley with a specific reproducer
   - Reviewed by Petr Mladek (printk maintainer)
   - Tested by the original reporter
   - Already included upstream (commit
     571c1ea91a73db56bd94054fabecd0f070dc90db)

## Code Analysis

The key changes in `nbcon_context_try_acquire_direct()`:
```c
-static int nbcon_context_try_acquire_direct(struct nbcon_context *ctxt,
- struct nbcon_state *cur)
+static int nbcon_context_try_acquire_direct(struct nbcon_context *ctxt,
+                                           struct nbcon_state *cur,
bool is_reacquire)
```

And the critical logic change:
```c
-if (other_cpu_in_panic())
+if (other_cpu_in_panic() &&
+    (!is_reacquire || cur->unsafe_takeover)) {
     return -EPERM;
+}
```

This allows reacquire during panic only when it's a genuine reacquire
attempt and no unsafe takeover has occurred, which is a safe and
necessary exception to handle the described bug.

The commit follows stable kernel rules by fixing an important bug with
minimal risk and without introducing new features.
