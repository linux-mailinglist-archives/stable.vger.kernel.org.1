[ Upstream commit 2497ff38c530b1af0df5130ca9f5ab22c5e92f29 ]

`i2c_hid_xfer` is used to read `recv_len + sizeof(__le16)` bytes of data
into `ihid->rawbuf`.

The former can come from the userspace in the hidraw driver and is only
bounded by HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE(16384) by default (unless we also set
`max_buffer_size` field of `struct hid_ll_driver` which we do not).

The latter has size determined at runtime by the maximum size of
different report types you could receive on any particular device and
can be a much smaller value.

Fix this by truncating `recv_len` to `ihid->bufsize - sizeof(__le16)`.

The impact is low since access to hidraw devices requires root.

## Analysis of HID: i2c-hid: fix potential buffer overflow in
i2c_hid_get_report()

### 1. COMMIT MESSAGE ANALYSIS

The commit message clearly describes a **buffer overflow
vulnerability**:
- `recv_len` comes from userspace via the hidraw driver, bounded only by
  HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE (16384)
- `ihid->rawbuf` has size `ihid->bufsize` determined at runtime by
  device report sizes - can be much smaller
- The I2C transfer reads `recv_len + sizeof(__le16)` bytes into the
  potentially smaller buffer
- The fix truncates `recv_len` to prevent overflow

Key phrase: "fix potential buffer overflow" - this is a security fix.
The message acknowledges "impact is low since access to hidraw devices
requires root," but buffer overflows are still serious vulnerabilities.

### 2. CODE CHANGE ANALYSIS

The fix is a single line addition:
```c
recv_len = min(recv_len, ihid->bufsize - sizeof(__le16));
```

**Technical mechanism of the bug:**
- `i2c_hid_xfer()` is called with `recv_len + sizeof(__le16)` as the
  read length
- If userspace requests a large report via hidraw, `recv_len` could be
  up to 16384
- The destination buffer `ihid->rawbuf` has size `ihid->bufsize`, which
  is allocated based on the device's maximum report size
- If `recv_len + 2 > ihid->bufsize`, data is written past the end of
  `rawbuf`

**Why the fix is correct:**
- The `min()` ensures `recv_len ≤ ihid->bufsize - sizeof(__le16)`
- Therefore `recv_len + sizeof(__le16) ≤ ihid->bufsize` - no overflow
  possible
- Placement is perfect: right before the I2C transfer that performs the
  write

### 3. CLASSIFICATION

This is a **security bug fix** - specifically a buffer overflow that:
- Can be triggered from userspace (via hidraw)
- Could lead to kernel memory corruption
- Requires root access (limiting practical exploitability)

Even with limited exploitability, buffer overflows in kernel drivers are
exactly what stable trees want to fix for defense-in-depth.

### 4. SCOPE AND RISK ASSESSMENT

| Metric | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Lines changed | 1 |
| Files touched | 1 |
| Complexity | Trivial (min() call) |
| Subsystem maturity | High (i2c-hid is mature, widely used) |
| Risk of regression | Near zero |

The fix is **surgical and contained** - it only adds a bounds check. It
cannot break correct behavior since:
- Valid requests (where recv_len fits in the buffer) are unaffected
- Invalid requests (oversized) now get safely truncated instead of
  causing overflow

### 5. USER IMPACT

**Affected users:** Anyone using I2C-HID devices - common on laptops for
touchpads, touchscreens, and keyboards.

**Severity:** Buffer overflow = potentially high severity for security
(memory corruption, possible privilege escalation), though
exploitability is limited by root requirement.

**Real-world impact:** While requiring root reduces the attack surface,
compromised root processes or certain security models (containers,
sandboxes) make this relevant.

### 6. STABILITY INDICATORS

- Signed-off-by Benjamin Tissoires (HID subsystem maintainer)
- The fix is trivially verifiable as correct
- Standard defensive bounds checking pattern

### 7. DEPENDENCY CHECK

- Standalone fix, no dependencies on other commits
- `i2c_hid_get_report()` and the buffer management have existed for
  years
- Will apply cleanly to stable trees

### STABLE KERNEL RULES ASSESSMENT

| Criterion | Met? |
|-----------|------|
| Obviously correct and tested | ✅ Yes - trivial min() bounds check |
| Fixes a real bug | ✅ Yes - buffer overflow |
| Important issue (security/crash/corruption) | ✅ Yes - security
vulnerability |
| Small and contained | ✅ Yes - 1 line, 1 file |
| No new features | ✅ Yes - pure bug fix |
| Applies cleanly | ✅ Yes - no dependencies |

### RISK VS BENEFIT

**Benefit:** Fixes a buffer overflow vulnerability in widely-used HID
driver code
**Risk:** Effectively zero - the fix is a trivial bounds check that
cannot cause regressions

### CONCLUSION

This commit is an ideal candidate for stable backporting:
- It fixes a genuine security vulnerability (buffer overflow)
- The fix is minimal (1 line), obviously correct, and risk-free
- The i2c-hid driver is widely used on modern laptops
- Even though root is required to exploit, defense-in-depth principles
  favor fixing all buffer overflows
- Has proper maintainer sign-off

**YES**
