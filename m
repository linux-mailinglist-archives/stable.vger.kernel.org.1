It may be a matter of a better code comment (see below)...

Ok, this depends on what the gauges !=3D bq27000 and !=3D bq27Z561 would =
expect. This is something I
do not know, but maybe the community / maintainers.

And, there is a comment for the definition of BQ27000 that it is also =
meant for the bq27200, which has an i2c interface.
That one is obsolete but still may be used somewhere...

But if it does never return 0xff for the status register it would be =
fine for me.

I can't acccess the git repo at the moment, so here is what think this =
would mean:

@@ -1920,7 +1920,7 @@ static void bq27xxx_battery_update_unlocked(struct =
bq27xxx_device_info *di)

With the changed comment it should be more clear what it is doing and =
why.

Maybe can you test this? As soon as I can test, I'll report and submit a =
v2.
