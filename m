6.1-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Kees Cook <kees@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 2d4cf7b190bbfadd4986bf5c34da17c1a88adf8e ]

In preparation to support PT_LOAD with large p_align values on
non-PT_INTERP ET_DYN executables (i.e. "static pie"), we'll need to use
the total_size details earlier. Move this separately now to make the
next patch more readable. As total_size and load_bias are currently
calculated separately, this has no behavioral impact.
