Okay, it sounds like you're walking back your claim that there's a
second source of entropy.  That leaves just the 64-bit seed that the
driver writes to CRYPTO4XX_PRNG_SEED_L || CRYPTO4XX_PRNG_SEED_H, which
probably corresponds to the "first LFSR" you mentioned.  The driver
doesn't initialize the other LFSRs.

The option to download the file is paywalled.

Anyway, even if it turns out that this is secure (it won't), it's still
unused code that should be removed anyway.  The fact that it's not up to
modern security standards just provides some additional motivation.
