5.10-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

From: Sebastian Reichel <sebastian.reichel@collabora.com>

[ Upstream commit 1e61f6ab08786d66a11cfc51e13d6f08a6b06c56 ]

This patch fixes a race condition communication error, which ends up in
PD hard resets when losing the race. Some systems, like the Radxa ROCK
5B are powered through USB-C without any backup power source and use a
FUSB302 chip to do the PD negotiation. This means it is quite important
to avoid hard resets, since that effectively kills the system's
power-supply.

I've found the following race condition while debugging unplanned power
loss during booting the board every now and then:

1. lots of TCPM/FUSB302/PD initialization stuff
2. TCPM ends up in SNK_WAIT_CAPABILITIES (tcpm_set_pd_rx is enabled here)
3. the remote PD source does not send anything, so TCPM does a SOFT RESET
4. TCPM ends up in SNK_WAIT_CAPABILITIES for the second time
   (tcpm_set_pd_rx is enabled again, even though it is still on)

At this point I've seen broken CRC good messages being send by the
FUSB302 with a logic analyzer sniffing the CC lines. Also it looks like
messages are being lost and things generally going haywire with one of
the two sides doing a hard reset once a broken CRC good message was send
to the bus.

I think the system is running into a race condition, that the FIFOs are
being cleared and/or the automatic good CRC message generation flag is
being updated while a message is already arriving.

Let's avoid this by caching the PD RX enabled state, as we have already
processed anything in the FIFOs and are in a good state. As a side
effect that this also optimizes I2C bus usage :)

As far as I can tell the problem theoretically also exists when TCPM
enters SNK_WAIT_CAPABILITIES the first time, but I believe this is less
critical for the following reason:

On devices like the ROCK 5B, which are powered through a TCPM backed
USB-C port, the bootloader must have done some prior PD communication
(initial communication must happen within 5 seconds after plugging the
USB-C plug). This means the first time the kernel TCPM state machine
reaches SNK_WAIT_CAPABILITIES, the remote side is not sending messages
actively. On other devices a hard reset simply adds some extra delay and
things should be good afterwards.
