Mhm - the AI must be missing something, mainly because I went back and
double checked - and at least with runtime PM on this ampere machine
I'm immediately able to reproduce issues if I drop patch 3 (in
particular - job timeouts after runtime resume). The actual
suspend/resume process succeeds, but it leaves us with a GPU that
doesn't seem to be able to render anything:

[   93.167997] nouveau 0000:01:00.0: vkcube[11028]: job timeout, channel 4 =
killed!
