Subject: mm/mempolicy: correctly update prev when policy is equal on mbind
Date: Sun, 30 Apr 2023 16:07:07 +0100

The refactoring in commit f4e9e0e69468 ("mm/mempolicy: fix use-after-free
of VMA iterator") introduces a subtle bug which arises when attempting to
apply a new NUMA policy across a range of VMAs in mbind_range().

The refactoring passes a **prev pointer to keep track of the previous VMA
in order to reduce duplication, and in all but one case it keeps this
correctly updated.

The bug arises when a VMA within the specified range has an equivalent
policy as determined by mpol_equal() - which unlike other cases, does not
update prev.

This can result in a situation where, later in the iteration, a VMA is
found whose policy does need to change.  At this point, vma_merge() is
invoked with prev pointing to a VMA which is before the previous VMA.

Since vma_merge() discovers the curr VMA by looking for the one
immediately after prev, it will now be in a situation where this VMA is
incorrect and the merge will not proceed correctly.

This is checked in the VM_WARN_ON() invariant case with end >
curr->vm_end, which, if a merge is possible, results in a warning (if
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is specified).

I note that vma_merge() performs these invariant checks only after
merge_prev/merge_next are checked, which is debatable as it hides this
issue if no merge is possible even though a buggy situation has arisen.

The solution is simply to update the prev pointer even when policies are
equal.

This caused a bug to arise in the 6.2.y stable tree, and this patch
resolves this bug.
