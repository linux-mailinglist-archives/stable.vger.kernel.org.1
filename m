[ Upstream commit 68b1fa0ed5c84769e4e60d58f6a5af37e7273b51 ]

commit af38538801c6a ("mm/memory: factor out common code from vm_normal_page_*()"),
added a VM_WARN_ON_ONCE for huge zero pfn.

This can lead to the following call stack.

 ------------[ cut here ]------------

 [c00000016f56fe50] [c00000000000d05c] system_call_vectored_common+0x15c/0x2ec

This happens when we call mprotect -> change_huge_pmd()
mprotect()
  change_pmd_range()
    pmd_modify(oldpmd, newprot) 	# this clears _PAGE_SPECIAL for zero huge pmd
	    pmdv = pmd_val(pmd);
	    pmdv &= _HPAGE_CHG_MASK;	# -> gets cleared here
	    return pmd_set_protbits(__pmd(pmdv), newprot);
    can_change_pmd_writable(vma, vmf->address, pmd)
      vm_normal_page_pmd(vma, addr, pmd)
        __vm_normal_page()
          VM_WARN_ON(is_zero_pfn(pfn) || is_huge_zero_pfn(pfn));  # this get hits as _PAGE_SPECIAL for zero huge pmd was cleared.

It can be easily reproduced with the following testcase:
	p = mmap(NULL, 2 * hpage_pmd_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE |
		 MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
	madvise((void *)p, 2 * hpage_pmd_size, MADV_HUGEPAGE);
	aligned = (char*)(((unsigned long)p + hpage_pmd_size - 1) &
				~(hpage_pmd_size - 1));
	(void)(*(volatile char*)aligned);  // read fault, installs huge zero PMD
	mprotect((void *)aligned, hpage_pmd_size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE);

This patch adds _PAGE_SPECIAL to _HPAGE_CHG_MASK similar to
_PAGE_CHG_MASK, as we don't want to clear this bit when calling
pmd_modify() while changing protection bits.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Now I have a complete picture. Let me compile the full analysis.

---

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: Subject Line**
- Subsystem: `powerpc/64s`
- Action verb: "Fix" - explicitly a bug fix
- Summary: Fix `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK` to include `_PAGE_SPECIAL` bit,
  preventing it from being stripped during `pmd_modify()`

**Step 1.2: Tags**
- No `Fixes:` tag (expected for this pipeline)
- No `Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org` (expected)
- `Signed-off-by: Ritesh Harjani (IBM)` - the author
- `Tested-by: Venkat Rao Bagalkote` - independently tested
- `Signed-off-by: Madhavan Srinivasan` - powerpc subsystem maintainer
- `Link:` to patch.msgid.link with the original submission

**Step 1.3: Commit Body**
The commit describes a concrete bug: when `mprotect()` is called on a
mapping with a huge zero PMD, `pmd_modify()` strips `_PAGE_SPECIAL`
because `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK` doesn't include it. This causes
`vm_normal_page_pmd()` to hit a `VM_WARN_ON` for zero huge pfn. A
complete call trace is provided, along with a simple reproducible
testcase.

**Step 1.4: Hidden Bug Fix?**
Not hidden at all - this is an explicitly stated fix with "Fix" in the
subject.

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

**Step 2.1: Inventory**
- Single file changed: `arch/powerpc/include/asm/book3s/64/pgtable.h`
- Net change: 2 lines changed (adding `_PAGE_SPECIAL |` to the mask,
  reformatting)
- Effectively a 1-token addition to a preprocessor bitmask

**Step 2.2: Code Flow Change**
Before: `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK` does not include `_PAGE_SPECIAL`, so
`pmd_modify()` clears this bit.
After: `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK` includes `_PAGE_SPECIAL`, preserving it through
`pmd_modify()`.

**Step 2.3: Bug Mechanism**
Logic/correctness fix. The `_PAGE_CHG_MASK` (for regular PTEs) already
includes `_PAGE_SPECIAL` at line 123-125 of the same file. The
`_HPAGE_CHG_MASK` (for huge PMDs) was missing it, creating an
inconsistency where `pmd_modify()` strips `_PAGE_SPECIAL` while
`pte_modify()` preserves it.

**Step 2.4: Fix Quality**
- Obviously correct: makes the huge page mask match the regular page
  mask
- Minimal and surgical: single bit addition to a bitmask
- Zero regression risk: preserving a bit that should always be preserved
- Historical precedent: commit fbc78b07ba53 (2009) fixed the same issue
  for `_PAGE_CHG_MASK`

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY

**Step 3.1: Blame**
The `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK` definition was introduced by commit
`2e8735198af039` (Aneesh Kumar K.V, 2016-04-29) when powerpc moved
common PTE bits to `book3s/64/pgtable.h`. The `_PAGE_SPECIAL` was
missing from `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK` from the very beginning while it was
present in `_PAGE_CHG_MASK`. The bug has existed since 2016, meaning all
active stable trees have this bug.

**Step 3.2: Fixes Tag**
No explicit `Fixes:` tag, but the buggy commit is `2e8735198af039` which
exists in all active stable trees (v4.8+).

**Step 3.3: Related Changes**
- Commit `548cb932051fb` ("x86/mm: Fix PAT bit missing from page
  protection modify mask") - analogous fix on x86 for a similar issue
  with `_PAGE_PAT` missing from the modify mask. This shows this is a
  known class of bugs.
- Commit `fbc78b07ba53` ("powerpc/mm: Fix _PAGE_CHG_MASK to protect
  _PAGE_SPECIAL") from 2009 - exact same type of fix but for the regular
  PTE mask.

**Step 3.4: Author**
Ritesh Harjani is a regular powerpc contributor at IBM with many commits
in this subsystem.

**Step 3.5: Dependencies**
This commit is fully standalone. No prerequisites needed.

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST

- b4 dig could not find the exact commit hash (it's not yet in the
  mainline tree referenced by b4).
- The `Link:` tag points to `patch.msgid.link/7416f5cdbcfeaad947860fcac4
  88b483f1287172.1773078178.git.ritesh.list@gmail.com`
- Lore was inaccessible due to anti-bot protection.
- The commit was accepted by the powerpc maintainer Madhavan Srinivasan,
  indicating proper review.

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1-5.4: Key Functions**
- `pmd_modify()` in `arch/powerpc/mm/book3s64/pgtable.c:277` uses
  `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK` to filter bits.
- `pud_modify()` at line 286 also uses `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK`.
- These are called from `change_huge_pmd()` in `mm/huge_memory.c:2625`
  during `mprotect()`.
- `change_huge_pmd()` then calls `can_change_pmd_writable()` which calls
  `vm_normal_page_pmd()`.
- `vm_normal_page_pmd()` calls `__vm_normal_page()` which has a
  `VM_WARN_ON_ONCE` for zero pfns.

The call chain is: `sys_mprotect()` -> `do_mprotect_pkey()` ->
`mprotect_fixup()` -> `change_protection()` -> `change_pmd_range()` ->
`change_huge_pmd()` -> `pmd_modify()` (loses `_PAGE_SPECIAL`) ->
`can_change_pmd_writable()` -> `vm_normal_page_pmd()` -> `VM_WARN_ON`.

This is reachable from any unprivileged userspace `mprotect()` call on a
THP-backed mapping.

## PHASE 6: STABLE TREE ANALYSIS

**Step 6.1:** The buggy `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK` definition has been present
since v4.8 (2016). All active stable trees contain this bug.

**Step 6.2:** The fix will apply cleanly - the `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK`
definition is stable and hasn't changed significantly (last modification
by `d438d273417055` removed `_PAGE_DEVMAP`).

**Step 6.3:** No related fix has been applied to stable for this issue.

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM CONTEXT

- Subsystem: `powerpc/64s` - architecture-specific memory management
- Criticality: IMPORTANT - affects all powerpc book3s 64-bit systems
  using THP
- The code touches page table bit handling, a critical part of the
  memory subsystem

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

**Step 8.1:** Affects users of powerpc book3s 64-bit systems with THP
enabled.

**Step 8.2:** Triggered by `mprotect()` on a huge zero page mapping. The
reproducer is simple: mmap + madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE) + read fault +
mprotect. Any unprivileged user can trigger it.

**Step 8.3:** Failure mode: Kernel warning (VM_WARN_ON), incorrect page
treatment (zero page treated as normal page after mprotect). MEDIUM-HIGH
severity - causes kernel splats and potentially incorrect memory
management decisions.

**Step 8.4:**
- BENEFIT: HIGH - fixes a bug triggerable from userspace via common
  operations, prevents kernel warnings and incorrect page handling
- RISK: VERY LOW - single bit addition to a bitmask, obviously correct
  by analogy with `_PAGE_CHG_MASK`
- Ratio: Strongly favorable

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Evidence FOR backporting:**
- Fixes a real bug with concrete reproducer and call trace
- Single-bit addition to a bitmask - trivially small and obviously
  correct
- Makes `_HPAGE_CHG_MASK` consistent with `_PAGE_CHG_MASK` (which
  already has `_PAGE_SPECIAL`)
- Historical precedent: same fix for regular PTEs (2009) and for x86
  (2023)
- Tested independently, accepted by subsystem maintainer
- Bug exists in all stable trees since 2016
- Zero regression risk

**Evidence AGAINST backporting:**
- The `VM_WARN_ON` that makes this most visible (from `af38538801c6a`)
  is only in recent kernels (6.18+)
- powerpc does not define `pmd_special()` (returns false generically),
  so the full mechanism is subtle

**Stable Rules Checklist:**
1. Obviously correct? **YES** - trivial consistency fix
2. Fixes a real bug? **YES** - `_PAGE_SPECIAL` incorrectly stripped
   during `pmd_modify()`
3. Important issue? **YES** - kernel warning + incorrect page handling
4. Small and contained? **YES** - 1 line in 1 file
5. No new features? **YES**
6. Applies cleanly? **YES**
