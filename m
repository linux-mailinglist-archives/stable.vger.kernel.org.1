I agree, that name is super irritating.  I don't even know how to
figure out or verify that pci_d3cold_disable() also disables D3hot.

Even if users don't intentionally turn off wakeup, there are devices
like mass storage and NICs without wake-on-LAN that don't require
wakeup.

I assume that if there's no downstream device that needs wakeup, this
quirk means we will keep the Root Port in D0 even though we could
safely put it in D3hot or D3cold.

That's one thing I liked about the v20 iteration -- instead of
pci_d3cold_disable(), we changed dev->pme_support, which should mean
that we only avoid D3hot/D3cold if we need PMEs while in those states,
so I assumed that we *could* use D3 when we don't need the wakeups.
