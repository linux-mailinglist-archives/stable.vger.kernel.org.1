There are no "closed doors" here, everything we apply is sent to the
public, so the lack of an email will mean it was not applied.  We can't
spam the lists with "well I tried this patch on this tree and it didn't
work" messages all the time, as that would be a mess, especially as
changes like this were NOT asked to be backported, we just took the time
to attempt to do so on our own accord.

Again, patches that are explicitly asked to be applied, and fail, will
be notified if they fail.  Patches that are not asked to be applied, and
we try to do so anyway because it looks like they might be relevant, and
they fail, will not be applied as it would seem that the original author
was correct in that it shouldn't have been applied.

It's a different patch stream and workflow.  One that some people have
suggested that we maybe just stop doing entirely (i.e. don't take
anything that is not explicitly marked), but that would mean that many
subsystems would never get any backports done for them because they
never mark anything.  So we do the best that we can, and do not bother
the subsystems that do not want to be part of the stable backport
process, which is totally legitimate as it is extra effort on their part
and that is the first rule of the stable kernel process when we created
them:
	- we will not impose any extra work on any maintainer or
	  developer if they do not want to do it.

Also, when asking "why wasn't this patch applied?", 90% of the time a
simple "let me go apply it and build it" will show that it either
doesn't apply, or breaks the build, which will save people a round-trip
in emails as that's the obvious answer :)
