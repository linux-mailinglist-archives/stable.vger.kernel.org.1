For further clarification, see the ARM Architecture Reference Manual,
DDI0100E, which introduced BKPT, page 114, but specifically page 115
which states in the notes:

"Hardware override
"Debug hardware in an implementation is specifically permitted to
override the normal behavior of the BKPT instruction. Because of
this, software must not use this instruction for purposes other than
those documented by the debug system being used (if any). In
particular, software cannot rely on the Prefetch Abort exception
occurring, unless either there is guaranteed to be no debug hardware
in the system or the debug system specifies that it will occur.

"For more information, consult the documentation for the debug
system being used."

DDI0406C also mentions C2.2 states that if DBGEN is enabled, then
all debug events become halting and cause the CPU to enter debug
state (for a hardware debugger to respond to.) However, the above
statement is no longer present, but is covered via other means.
Indeed, a JTAG hardware debugger can still override BKPT to
put the CPU into debug mode and omit to generate the Prefetch
Abort exception.

Thus, BKPT isn't guaranteed to raise a prefetch abort depending
on whether there's a hardware debugger connected and how that
debugger has configured the interface.
