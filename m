[ Upstream commit 21a9ab5b90b3716a631d559e62818029b4e7f5b7 ]

The PureAudio APA DAC and Lotus DAC5 series are USB Audio
2.0 Class devices that support native Direct Stream Digital (DSD)
playback via specific vendor protocols.

Without these quirks, the devices may only function in standard
PCM mode, or fail to correctly report their DSD format capabilities
to the ALSA framework, preventing native DSD playback under Linux.

This commit adds new quirk entries for the mentioned DAC models
based on their respective Vendor/Product IDs (VID:PID), for example:
0x16d0:0x0ab1 (APA DAC), 0x16d0:0xeca1 (DAC5 series), etc.

The quirk ensures correct DSD format handling by setting the required
SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_DSD_U32_BE format bit and defining the DSD-specific
Audio Class 2.0 (AC2.0) endpoint configurations. This allows the ALSA
DSD API to correctly address the device for high-bitrate DSD streams,
bypassing the need for DoP (DSD over PCM).

Test on APA DAC and Lotus DAC5 SE under Arch Linux.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Now let me create a comprehensive analysis based on all the information
gathered:

## COMPREHENSIVE COMMIT ANALYSIS

### COMMIT IDENTIFICATION
- **Subject**: ALSA: usb-audio: Add native DSD quirks for PureAudio DAC
  series
- **Mainline commit**: 21a9ab5b90b37
- **First appeared in**: v6.18-rc6
- **Files modified**: sound/usb/quirks.c (1 file, 6 lines added)
- **Already backported to**: Multiple stable trees (6.17.y, 6.12.y,
  6.6.y, 6.1.y)

### 1. COMMIT MESSAGE ANALYSIS

The commit message is clear and well-documented:
- **Problem statement**: "Without these quirks, the devices may only
  function in standard PCM mode, or fail to correctly report their DSD
  format capabilities to the ALSA framework, preventing native DSD
  playback under Linux."
- **What's being added**: USB quirk entries for PureAudio APA DAC
  (0x16d0:0x0ab1) and Lotus DAC5 series (0x16d0:0xeca1)
- **Testing**: Explicitly tested on APA DAC and Lotus DAC5 SE under Arch
  Linux with "Tested-by:" tag
- **Key indicators**: No "Fixes:" tag (this enables new hardware, not
  fixing a regression), but has "Tested-by:" tag

### 2. DEEP CODE RESEARCH

**Understanding the Quirk Infrastructure:**

The ALSA USB audio subsystem has a well-established quirk mechanism for
handling devices that don't conform perfectly to USB Audio Class
specifications. This commit uses the `QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW`
infrastructure, which was introduced in **commit 68e851ee4cfd2
(v5.15-rc3, July 2021)** by Takashi Iwai. That commit stated:

> "The generic DSD raw detection is based on the known allow list, and
we can integrate it into quirk_flags, too."

The infrastructure has been stable for **over 3 years** and is present
in all stable kernels from 5.15.y onwards.

**How the Code Works:**

The commit makes changes in two locations within `sound/usb/quirks.c`:

1. **Lines 2017-2037**: In `snd_usb_interface_dsd_format_quirks()`
   function - a switch statement that checks USB device IDs. When the
   device matches one of the listed IDs (including the newly added
   PureAudio devices), it returns `SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_DSD_U32_BE` format
   flag for altsetting 3.

2. **Lines ~2301**: In the `quirk_flags_table[]` - adds the device IDs
   with the `QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW` flag, which enables the generic DSD
   detection path (lines 2076-2077):
```c
if ((chip->quirk_flags & QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW) && fp->dsd_raw)
    return SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_DSD_U32_BE;
```

**What Problem This Solves:**

These specific DAC models support native Direct Stream Digital (DSD)
playback, but without the quirk entries, the ALSA framework doesn't
recognize their DSD capabilities. The hardware exists and works, but
Linux can't properly utilize its DSD features. This is a **hardware
enablement** issue, not a bug in existing code.

**Pattern Consistency:**

Looking at the vendor ID 0x16d0, I found numerous other devices from the
same vendor already in the quirk list:
- 0x16d0:0x06b2 (NuPrime DAC-10)
- 0x16d0:0x06b4 (NuPrime Audio HD-AVP/AVA)
- 0x16d0:0x0733 (Furutech ADL Stratos)
- 0x16d0:0x09d8 (NuPrime IDA-8)
- 0x16d0:0x09db (NuPrime Audio DAC-9)
- 0x16d0:0x09dd (Encore mDSD)
- 0x16d0:0x071a (Amanero - Combo384)

The new PureAudio devices (0x16d0:0x0ab1 and 0x16d0:0xeca1) fit
perfectly into this established pattern.

**Similar Recent Commits:**

Several identical patterns exist in recent history:
- **Luxman D-08u** (commit 6b0bde5d8d407, Oct 2024): Added native DSD
  support with "Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>" tag
- **Comtrue USB Audio** (commit e9df1755485dd, July 2025): Added DSD
  support with QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW
- **ddHiFi TC44C** (commit c84bd6c810d18): Enabled DSD output
- **McIntosh devices** (commit 99248c8902f50): Added quirk flag for
  native DSD

All of these follow the same pattern and have been successfully
backported to stable trees.

### 3. SECURITY ASSESSMENT

No security implications. This is purely hardware enablement.

### 4. FEATURE VS BUG FIX CLASSIFICATION

**This is NOT a traditional bug fix, BUT it falls under STABLE TREE
EXCEPTIONS:**

According to stable kernel rules, this qualifies as a **HARDWARE
QUIRK/WORKAROUND exception**:

From the guidelines:
> "QUIRKS and WORKAROUNDS:
> - Hardware-specific quirks for broken/buggy devices
> - These fix real-world hardware issues even though they add code"

The devices exist in the wild, users own them, but they can't use native
DSD playback under Linux without this quirk. This is fixing
broken/incomplete hardware support.

This also relates to the **NEW DEVICE ID exception**:
> "NEW DEVICE IDs (Very Common):
> - Adding PCI IDs, USB IDs, ACPI IDs, etc. to existing drivers
> - These are trivial one-line additions that enable hardware support
> - Rule: The driver must already exist in stable; only the ID is new"

The USB audio driver exists, the DSD quirk infrastructure exists (since
v5.15), only the device IDs are new.

### 5. CODE CHANGE SCOPE ASSESSMENT

**Extremely small and surgical:**
- **1 file changed**: sound/usb/quirks.c
- **6 lines added**: 2 USB_ID() entries in the switch statement, 2
  DEVICE_FLG() entries in the quirk flags table
- **0 lines removed**
- **No new functions, no API changes, no algorithmic changes**
- **Follows exact pattern** used dozens of times in this file

**Code structure:**
```c
// Addition 1: In DSD format quirks switch statement
case USB_ID(0x16d0, 0x09dd): /* Encore mDSD */
+case USB_ID(0x16d0, 0x0ab1): /* PureAudio APA DAC */
+case USB_ID(0x16d0, 0xeca1): /* PureAudio Lotus DAC5, DAC5 SE, DAC5 Pro
*/
case USB_ID(0x1db5, 0x0003): /* Bryston BDA3 */

// Addition 2: In quirk flags table
DEVICE_FLG(0x1686, 0x00dd, /* Zoom R16/24 */
           QUIRK_FLAG_TX_LENGTH | QUIRK_FLAG_CTLMSG_DELAY_1M),
+DEVICE_FLG(0x16d0, 0x0ab1, /* PureAudio APA DAC */
+           QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW),
+DEVICE_FLG(0x16d0, 0xeca1, /* PureAudio Lotus DAC5, DAC5 SE and DAC5
Pro */
+           QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW),
DEVICE_FLG(0x17aa, 0x1046, /* Lenovo ThinkStation P620... */
```

This is as trivial as it gets.

### 6. BUG TYPE AND SEVERITY

**Type**: Hardware enablement / Incomplete hardware support
**Severity**: LOW to MEDIUM for affected users
- Users with these specific DAC models cannot use native DSD playback
- They can still use PCM mode, so the devices aren't completely broken
- This is a quality-of-life improvement for audiophiles who paid for
  DSD-capable hardware
- No crashes, no data corruption, no security issues

### 7. USER IMPACT EVALUATION

**Who is affected:**
- **Only users** who own PureAudio APA DAC or Lotus DAC5 series devices
- Very narrow, device-specific impact
- These are high-end audiophile DACs (not mainstream consumer devices)

**Impact if NOT backported:**
- Users upgrading to stable kernels won't get native DSD support for
  their hardware
- They're forced to use older kernels or wait for major kernel upgrade
- Frustrating for users who specifically bought these devices for Linux

**Impact if backported:**
- Users with these devices get native DSD playback capability
- Zero impact on users without these devices (device-specific quirk)
- Consistent with Linux philosophy of wide hardware support

**Code path analysis:**
The quirk only activates when:
1. The USB device ID matches 0x16d0:0x0ab1 or 0x16d0:0xeca1
2. The device reports DSD capability (fp->dsd_raw)
3. The correct altsetting is selected

This means the code path is **never executed** for other devices - zero
impact on anything else.

### 8. REGRESSION RISK ANALYSIS

**Risk: VERY LOW**

**Why it's safe:**
1. **Device-specific**: Only affects two specific USB device IDs that
   don't exist in older kernels
2. **Well-tested infrastructure**: QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW has been in use
   since v5.15 (2021)
3. **Proven pattern**: Dozens of similar device additions without issues
4. **Tested hardware**: "Tested-by:" tag indicates real-world
   verification
5. **No behavior changes**: Doesn't modify existing code paths, only
   adds entries to tables
6. **Idempotent**: Adding the same quirk multiple times would be
   harmless (no side effects)

**Potential risks (extremely low probability):**
- Vendor could have reused USB IDs (very unlikely, violates USB
  standards)
- Device firmware bug could cause issues (but tested hardware shows it
  works)

**Mitigation:**
- The change is trivially revertible if any issues arise
- Impact radius is limited to specific hardware owners who can test

### 9. MAINLINE STABILITY

**Testing maturity:**
- First appeared in v6.18-rc6 (November 2025)
- Has "Tested-by: Lushih Hsieh" tag
- Already backported to multiple stable trees (6.17.y, 6.12.y, 6.6.y,
  6.1.y) by stable maintainers
- No reports of issues in mainline

**Maintainer confidence:**
- Signed-off-by: Takashi Iwai (ALSA maintainer)
- Takashi Iwai designed the QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW infrastructure
- Follows established patterns in the subsystem

### 10. HISTORICAL PATTERN REVIEW

**Similar commits that WERE backported to stable:**

1. **Luxman D-08u** (6b0bde5d8d407): Explicitly tagged "Cc:
   <stable@vger.kernel.org>"
2. **Comtrue USB Audio** (e9df1755485dd): Backported to v6.16.10,
   v6.12.50, v6.6.109
3. Multiple other DSD device additions

**Pattern**: Device ID additions for DSD-capable DACs are **routinely
accepted** into stable trees.

**Consistency check:**
The file sound/usb/quirks.c has received 46 commits since 2023, many of
which are simple device ID additions. This is an actively maintained
area where small hardware enablement patches are expected and accepted.

### 11. DEPENDENCY CHECK

**Infrastructure requirements:**
- Requires QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW (introduced in v5.15-rc3)
- Requires USB audio driver infrastructure (always present)
- No other dependencies

**Applicable stable trees:**
- ✅ All stable trees >= 5.15.y (QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW exists)
- ✅ 6.17.y, 6.12.y, 6.6.y, 6.1.y (already backported)
- ✅ 5.15.y, 5.19.y, 6.0.y, 6.10.y, 6.11.y (should be fine)
- ❌ Older than 5.15.y (QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW doesn't exist)

### 12. STABLE KERNEL RULES COMPLIANCE

**Does it meet stable criteria?**

✅ **Obviously correct and tested**: Trivial device ID additions
following established pattern
✅ **Fixes real issue**: Users can't use native DSD on their hardware
without this
✅ **Small and contained**: 1 file, 6 lines, device-specific
✅ **No new features**: Enables existing DSD infrastructure for new
device IDs (exception case)
✅ **No API changes**: Pure data additions to quirk tables
✅ **Applies cleanly**: Already backported to multiple stable trees
without issues

**Exception category**: **HARDWARE QUIRKS and NEW DEVICE IDs** - both
explicitly allowed in stable rules

**From stable kernel documentation:**
> "Adding PCI IDs, USB IDs, ACPI IDs, etc. to existing drivers - These
are trivial one-line additions that enable hardware support - Rule: The
driver must already exist in stable; only the ID is new"

This commit satisfies all these requirements.

### COMPARISON WITH SIMILAR COMMITS

The Luxman D-08u commit (6b0bde5d8d407) is **nearly identical**:
- Same file modified
- Same pattern (added 2 lines for device ID and quirk flag)
- Same DSD enablement purpose
- **Had explicit "Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>" tag**
- Successfully backported without issues

If the Luxman commit was appropriate for stable (and maintainers agreed
since they backported it), then this PureAudio commit is equally
appropriate.

## DECISION RATIONALE

This commit should be backported to stable kernel trees for the
following reasons:

**Primary justifications:**
1. **Fits stable tree exceptions**: Falls under both "Hardware Quirks"
   and "New Device IDs" exception categories explicitly documented in
   stable-kernel-rules.rst
2. **Trivial, surgical change**: 6 lines adding device IDs to existing
   tables, following a pattern used dozens of times
3. **Zero regression risk**: Device-specific quirks that only activate
   for specific USB hardware that doesn't exist in older kernels
4. **Well-tested infrastructure**: Uses QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW mechanism
   stable since v5.15 (2021)
5. **Proven pattern**: Multiple identical commits successfully
   backported to stable (Luxman, Comtrue, etc.)
6. **Real user benefit**: Enables proper functionality for users who own
   this hardware
7. **Already backported**: Stable maintainers have already backported
   this to multiple trees, validating its appropriateness

**Risk/benefit analysis:**
- **Benefit**: Users with PureAudio DACs get native DSD support,
  improving their Linux experience
- **Risk**: Essentially zero - device-specific quirk with no impact on
  other hardware
- **Trade-off**: Strongly favors backporting

**Maintainer signal:**
- Already backported by stable maintainers to 6.17.y, 6.12.y, 6.6.y,
  6.1.y
- Similar Luxman commit had explicit "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org" tag
- Signed-off-by ALSA subsystem maintainer (Takashi Iwai)

**Applicable versions:**
All stable trees from 5.15.y onwards (where QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW
infrastructure exists)

**YES**
