From: Stefan Roesch <shr@devkernel.io>
Subject: mm: fix for negative counter: nr_file_hugepages
Date: Mon, 6 Nov 2023 10:19:18 -0800

While qualifiying the 6.4 release, the following warning was detected in
messages:

vmstat_refresh: nr_file_hugepages -15664

The warning is caused by the incorrect updating of the NR_FILE_THPS
counter in the function split_huge_page_to_list.  The if case is checking
for folio_test_swapbacked, but the else case is missing the check for
folio_test_pmd_mappable.  The other functions that manipulate the counter
like __filemap_add_folio and filemap_unaccount_folio have the
corresponding check.

I have a test case, which reproduces the problem. It can be found here:
  https://github.com/sroeschus/testcase/blob/main/vmstat_refresh/madv.c

The test case reproduces on an XFS filesystem. Running the same test
case on a BTRFS filesystem does not reproduce the problem.

AFAIK version 6.1 until 6.6 are affected by this problem.
