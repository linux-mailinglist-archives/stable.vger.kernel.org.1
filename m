So what's the actual resource that causes this ath11 regression? You seem 
possess that knowledge as you knew to create this patch.

of_reserved_mem_region_to_resource() does use resource_set_range() so how 
did the end address become 0? Is there perhaps some other bug being 
covered up with this patch to resource_size()?

???

resource_size() does return 0 when ->start = 0 and ->end = - 1 which is 
the correctly setup of a zero-sized resource (when flags are non-zero).

There's lots of resource setup code which does set resource end address 
properly by applying -1 to it.

This place does not tell you what ->end is expected to be set? Where did 
you infer that information?

I suspect this code would want to do resource_is_assigned() (which doesn't 
exists yet but would check only res->parent != NULL) or base the check on 
IORESOURCE_UNSET|IORESOURCE_DISABLED.

Often using resourse_size() (or a few other address based checks) in 
drivers is misguided, what drivers are more interested in is if the 
resource is valid and/or properly in the resource tree (assigned by 
the PCI core which implies it's valid too and has a non-zero size), not so 
much about it's size. As you can see, size itself not even used here at 
all, that is, this place never was interested in size but uses it as a 
proxy for something else (like also many other drivers do)!

Who creates such resources?

If flags are non-zero, those places should be fixed (I'm currently fixing 
one case from drivers/pci/probe.c thanks to you bringing this up :-)) but 
I think the number of places to fix are fewer than you seem to think. I 
read though all end assignments in PCI core and found only this single(!) 
problem there.

This looks wrong to me.

Lets try to fix the resource setup side instead. The real problem is in 
any code that sets ->end to zero when it wanted to set resource size to 
zero, which are not the same thing. To make it simpler (no need to 
manually apply -1 to the end address) and less error prone, we have 
helpers resource_set_range/size() and DEFINE_RES() that handle applying -1 
correctly.

Taking this suggestion from your other email:

> if (!res.flags && !res.start && !res.end)
> 	return 0;

IMO, the caller shouldn't be calling resource_size() at all when 
!res.flags as that indicates the caller is confused and doesn't really 
know what it is even checking for. If a driver does even know if the 
resource is valid (has a valid type) or not, it should be checking that 
_first_ (it might needs the size for valid resources but it should IMO 
still check validity of the resource first).

Also, as mentioned above, some/many drivers are not fundamentally 
interested in validity itself but whether the resource is assigned to the 
resource tree.

For valid resources, this extra check is entirely unnecessary.

I'd be supportive of adding

WARN_ON_ONCE(!res.flags)

...here but that will be likely a bit too noisy without first auditting 
many places (from stable people's perspective a triggering WARN_ON() => 
DoS). But that's IMO the direction kernel code should be heading.
