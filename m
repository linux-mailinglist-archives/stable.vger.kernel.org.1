Subject: [PATCH v2] fscrypt: don't use problematic non-inline crypto accelerators

From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

Make fscrypt no longer use Crypto API drivers for non-inline crypto
accelerators, even when the Crypto API prioritizes them over CPU-based
code (which unfortunately it often does).  These drivers tend to be
really problematic, especially for fscrypt's synchronous workload.

Specifically, exclude drivers that have CRYPTO_ALG_KERN_DRIVER_ONLY or
CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY set.  (Later, CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC should be
excluded too.  That's omitted for now to keep this commit backportable,
since until recently some CPU-based code had CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC set.)

There are two major issues with these drivers: bugs and performance.

First, these drivers tend to be buggy.  They're fundamentally much more
error-prone and harder to test than the CPU-based code, and they often
don't get tested before kernel releases.  Released drivers have
en/decrypted data incorrectly.  These bugs cause real issues for fscrypt
users who often didn't even want to use these drivers, for example:

- https://github.com/google/fscryptctl/issues/32
- https://github.com/google/fscryptctl/issues/9
- https://lore.kernel.org/r/PH0PR02MB731916ECDB6C613665863B6CFFAA2@PH0PR02MB7319.namprd02.prod.outlook.com

These drivers have also caused issues for dm-crypt users, including data
corruption and deadlocks.  Since Linux v5.10, dm-crypt has disabled most
of these drivers by excluding CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY.

Second, the CPU-based crypto tends to be faster, often *much* faster.
This may seem counterintuitive, but benchmarks clearly show it.  There's
a *lot* of overhead associated with going to a hardware driver, off the
CPU, and back again.  Measuring synchronous AES-256-XTS encryption of
4096-byte messages (fscrypt's workload) on two platforms with non-inline
crypto accelerators that I have access to:

  Intel Emerald Rapids server:

     xts-aes-vaes-avx512:  16171 MB/s  [CPU-based, Vector AES]
     xts(ecb(aes-generic)):  305 MB/s  [CPU-based, generic C code]
     qat_aes_xts:            289 MB/s  [Offload, Intel QuickAssist]

  Qualcomm SM8650 HDK:

     xts-aes-ce:            4301 MB/s  [CPU-based, ARMv8 Crypto Extensions]
     xts(ecb(aes-generic)):  265 MB/s  [CPU-based, generic C code]
     xts-aes-qce:             73 MB/s  [Offload, Qualcomm Crypto Engine]

So, using the "accelerators" is over 50 times slower than just using the
CPU.  Not only that, it's even slower than the generic C code, which
suggests that even on platforms whose CPUs lack AES instructions the
performance benefit of any accelerator would be marginal at best.

The usefulness of the accelerators could be improved with a different
software architecture that allows blocks to be efficiently en/decrypted
in parallel.  But fscrypt does not do that today, and even the async
support in the Crypto API isn't really all that efficient.  And even if
the accelerator was used perfectly efficiently, it seems unlikely to
help on small I/O requests, for which latency is really important.

As of this writing, the Crypto API prioritizes qat_aes_xts over
xts-aes-vaes-avx512.  Therefore, this commit greatly improves fscrypt
performance on Intel servers that have QAT and the QAT driver enabled.
qat_aes_xts is going to be deprioritized in the Crypto API (like I did
for xts-aes-qce recently too).  But as this seems to be a common pattern
with all the "accelerators", fscrypt should just disable all of them.

An argument that has been given in favor of non-inline crypto
accelerators is that they can protect keys in hardware.  But fscrypt
does not take advantage of that, so it is irrelevant.  (Also, it would
be quite difficult for fscrypt to do that.)

Note that fscrypt does support inline encryption engines, using raw or
hardware-wrapped keys.  These actually do work well and are widely used.
These do not use the "Crypto API" and are unaffected by this commit.
