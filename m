That's exactly what I mean about having too many assumptions here
about other parts of the kernel.  I like pme_support because it's the
most specific piece of information about the issue and we don't have
to know anything about how pci_target_state() works to understand it.

True.  But I can't get too excited about one config read in the resume
path.

Is it actually necessary to look up the Root Port here?  Would it be
enough if we removed D3 from the xHCI devices (0x162e, 0x162f, 0x1668,
0x1669), e.g., just do this:

  dev->pme_support &= ~((PCI_PM_CAP_PME_D3hot|PCI_PM_CAP_PME_D3cold) >>
                              PCI_PM_CAP_PME_SHIFT);

I assume that if we knew the xHCI couldn't generate wakeups from D3,
we would leave the xHCI in D0, and that would mean we'd also leave the
Root Port in D0?

Or is the desired behavior that we put the xHCI in D3hot/cold and only
leave the the Root Port in D0?
