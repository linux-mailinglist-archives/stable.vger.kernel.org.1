I believe you meant to ask "how do we know the PCI device is currently off". If
the pwrctrl device is created, then we for sure know that the pwrctrl driver
will power on the PCI device at some point (depending on when the driver gets
loaded). Even if the device was already powered on, we do not want to probe the
client driver because, we have seen race between pwrctrl driver and PCI client
driver probing in parallel. So I had imposed a devlink dependency (see
b458ff7e8176) that makes sure that the PCI client driver wouldn't get probed
until the pwrctrl driver (if the pwrctrl device was created) is probed. This
will ensure that the PCI device state is reset and initialized by the pwrctrl
driver before the client driver probes.

Again, it is not the pwrctrl device that is off, it is the PCI device. If it is
not turned on, yes VID read will fail, but why do we need to read the VID in the
first place if we know that the PCI device requires pwrctrl and the pwrctrl
driver is going to be probed later.

Yes, it is indeed an optimization.

To summarize, we have imposed a dependency between the PCI client driver and
pwrctrl driver to make sure that the PCI device state is fully reset and
initialized before the client driver probes. So irrespective of whether the PCI
device is already powered on or not, it is guaranteed by devlink that the PCI
client driver will only get probed *after* the pwrctrl driver (if the device
requires it). So we skip scanning the device further if the pwrctrl device is
created (which means, the device depends on pwrctrl driver to power manage it).
