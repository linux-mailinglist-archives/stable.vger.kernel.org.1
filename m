[ Upstream commit a02496a29463e7f0d1643e83aab28adb3dd03f1a ]

If byt_rt5640_prepare_and_enable_pll1() fails, the function returns
without calling clk_disable_unprepare() on priv->mclk, which was
already enabled earlier in the same code path. Add the missing
cleanup call to prevent the clock from leaking.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Now I have all the information needed for a comprehensive analysis. Let
me compile the findings.

---

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: Subject Line**
- Subsystem: `ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640`
- Action verb: **Fix** (explicit bug fix)
- Summary: Fix MCLK clock leak on `platform_clock_control` error path.

**Step 1.2: Tags**
- `Signed-off-by: Aravind Anilraj <aravindanilraj0702@gmail.com>` -
  Author
- `Reviewed-by: Cezary Rojewski <cezary.rojewski@intel.com>` - Intel
  audio developer reviewed
- `Link: https://patch.msgid.link/20260401220507.23557-2-
  aravindanilraj0702@gmail.com` - Lore link
- `Signed-off-by: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>` - Merged by ASoC
  subsystem maintainer
- No Fixes: tag (expected for this review pipeline)
- No Cc: stable (expected)

**Step 1.3: Commit Body**
The body clearly describes the bug: When
`byt_rt5640_prepare_and_enable_pll1()` fails, the function returns
without calling `clk_disable_unprepare()` on `priv->mclk`, which was
already enabled by `clk_prepare_enable()`. This is a textbook resource
leak on an error path.

**Step 1.4: Hidden Bug Fix Detection**
Not hidden — this is explicitly labeled as a fix. The word "Fix" is in
the subject, and the mechanism (clock leak) is clearly described.

Record: [ASoC Intel bytcr_rt5640] [fix] [MCLK clock leak on PLL1 enable
error path] [Not a hidden fix - explicitly labeled]

---

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

**Step 2.1: Inventory**
- 1 file changed: `sound/soc/intel/boards/bytcr_rt5640.c`
- +2 lines added (only)
- Function modified: `platform_clock_control()`
- Scope: Single-file surgical fix, extremely minimal

**Step 2.2: Code Flow Change**
Before: If `byt_rt5640_prepare_and_enable_pll1()` fails at line 291,
`ret < 0`, the function falls through to line 305 and returns the error,
but `priv->mclk` remains enabled (was enabled at line 286).

After: If `byt_rt5640_prepare_and_enable_pll1()` fails,
`clk_disable_unprepare(priv->mclk)` is called immediately, releasing the
clock before the error return.

**Step 2.3: Bug Mechanism**
Category: **Error path / resource leak fix**. The clock was enabled via
`clk_prepare_enable()` but not cleaned up on failure of the subsequent
PLL1 setup. This is a classic missing-cleanup-on-error pattern.

**Step 2.4: Fix Quality**
- Obviously correct: YES. The symmetry is clear — `clk_prepare_enable()`
  succeeded, so on failure we must call `clk_disable_unprepare()`.
- Minimal/surgical: YES. Only 2 lines added.
- Regression risk: Extremely low. The added code only runs on the error
  path when PLL1 setup fails.

Record: [1 file, +2 lines, platform_clock_control()] [Resource leak fix:
MCLK left enabled on PLL1 failure] [Obviously correct, zero regression
risk]

---

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

**Step 3.1: Blame**
The buggy code pattern was introduced by commit `bcd9a325f0b0f4` (Hans
de Goede, 2018-05-08): "ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Configure PLL1 before
using it". This commit added the `byt_rt5640_prepare_and_enable_pll1()`
call after `clk_prepare_enable()` but failed to add cleanup on its
failure path.

The MCLK handling was further cleaned up by commit `a15ca6e3b8a21f`
(Andy Shevchenko, 2021-10-07), which removed the `BYT_RT5640_MCLK_EN`
quirk guard but preserved the same missing-cleanup bug.

**Step 3.2: Fixes Tag**
No Fixes: tag present (expected). The root cause commit is
`bcd9a325f0b0f4` from 2018. Verified present in v6.1, v6.6, and all
active stable trees.

**Step 3.3: File History**
Recent changes to the file are mostly DMI quirk additions and cosmetic
refactoring. No conflicting changes to the `platform_clock_control()`
function.

**Step 3.4: Author**
Aravind Anilraj has no other commits in this tree — likely a new
contributor. However, the patch was reviewed by Cezary Rojewski (Intel
audio team) and merged by Mark Brown (ASoC maintainer), providing strong
quality assurance.

**Step 3.5: Dependencies**
None. The fix is 2 self-contained lines. No new functions, structures,
or APIs involved.

Record: [Bug introduced 2018 in bcd9a325f0b0f4, present in all stable
trees] [Reviewed by Intel developer, merged by ASoC maintainer]
[Standalone fix, no dependencies]

---

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH

**Step 4.1-4.2**: Lore was inaccessible due to anti-bot protections.
However, the `Link:` tag confirms this was submitted and reviewed via
normal mailing list processes. The `Reviewed-by: Cezary Rojewski` (Intel
audio) confirms expert review. Mark Brown (ASoC maintainer) merged it.

**Step 4.3**: No Reported-by tag — this was found by code inspection,
not a user report.

**Step 4.4**: The same bug exists in sibling driver `bytcr_rt5651.c`
(lines 206-231) — identical pattern of `clk_prepare_enable()` followed
by `byt_rt5651_prepare_and_enable_pll1()` without cleanup on failure.
This confirms it's a systematic, real bug.

Record: [Reviewed by Intel audio developer, merged by ASoC maintainer]
[Same bug pattern confirmed in sibling driver bytcr_rt5651]

---

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1**: Function modified: `platform_clock_control()`

**Step 5.2: Callers**
`platform_clock_control` is registered as a DAPM supply widget callback:

```340:350:sound/soc/intel/boards/bytcr_rt5640.c
SND_SOC_DAPM_SUPPLY("Platform Clock", SND_SOC_NOPM, 0, 0,
                    platform_clock_control, SND_SOC_DAPM_PRE_PMU |
                    SND_SOC_DAPM_POST_PMD),
```

This is called by the DAPM framework every time audio playback/capture
starts or stops — a **common, hot path** for any Bay Trail tablet/laptop
user.

**Step 5.3-5.4**: `byt_rt5640_prepare_and_enable_pll1()` calls
`snd_soc_dai_set_pll()` and `snd_soc_dai_set_sysclk()`, both of which
can fail (e.g., codec communication error). The leak path is reachable
from normal audio usage.

**Step 5.5**: Identical bug pattern exists in `bytcr_rt5651.c`
(confirmed via grep).

Record: [platform_clock_control called on every audio start/stop via
DAPM] [Bug reachable from normal user audio usage] [Same pattern in
sibling driver]

---

## PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AND STABLE TREE ANALYSIS

**Step 6.1**: Verified that both the root cause commit `bcd9a325f0b0f4`
(2018) and the MCLK refactor `a15ca6e3b8a21f` (2021) are ancestors of
v6.1 and v6.6. The buggy code exists in **all active stable trees**.

**Step 6.2**: The only potential backport complication is commit
`e6995aa816557` (DAPM API conversion, Nov 2025), which changed line 276
from the old DAPM API to the new one. This commit is only in v6.19+. For
v6.1/v6.6/v6.12/v6.18, the context may differ slightly on line 276, but
the fix (+2 lines after line 291) is so localized it should apply
cleanly or with trivial fuzz.

**Step 6.3**: No related fixes already in stable for this issue.

Record: [Bug exists in all active stable trees v6.1+] [Clean apply or
trivial fuzz expected] [No existing fixes in stable]

---

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT

**Step 7.1**: Subsystem: `sound/soc/intel/boards` — Intel ASoC machine
drivers. Criticality: **IMPORTANT**. Bay Trail RT5640/RT5651 is used on
many x86 tablets and low-cost laptops (Asus T100, Lenovo IdeaPad,
various Atom-based devices).

**Step 7.2**: The file has moderate activity (DMI quirks being added
regularly, confirming active hardware user base).

Record: [ASoC Intel Bay Trail boards] [IMPORTANT — real hardware with
active users]

---

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

**Step 8.1**: Affected: Users of Intel Bay Trail devices with RT5640
codec (common Atom-based tablets and laptops).

**Step 8.2**: Trigger: Every audio playback start when
`byt_rt5640_prepare_and_enable_pll1()` fails (e.g., I2C communication
error with codec). The clock leak accumulates — each failure leaves MCLK
enabled, potentially causing power management issues and preventing the
clock from being properly reused.

**Step 8.3**: Severity: **MEDIUM-HIGH**. Clock resource leak can cause:
- Power management problems (clock stays active preventing deeper sleep
  states)
- Potential clock framework warnings/errors on subsequent audio
  operations
- Accumulated leaks over time

**Step 8.4**: Risk-Benefit:
- BENEFIT: Fixes a real resource leak in a commonly-used audio driver on
  real hardware
- RISK: Extremely low — 2 lines added to an error path only, obviously
  correct symmetry with `clk_prepare_enable`/`clk_disable_unprepare`
- Ratio: **Very favorable**

Record: [Bay Trail device users] [Triggered on PLL1 failure during audio
start] [Clock leak -> power management issues] [Extremely low risk,
moderate-high benefit]

---

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Step 9.1: Evidence Summary**

FOR backporting:
- Fixes a real resource leak (clock not unprepared on error path)
- Tiny, surgical fix: only +2 lines
- Obviously correct: symmetric cleanup of `clk_prepare_enable()`
- Reviewed by Intel audio developer (Cezary Rojewski)
- Merged by ASoC maintainer (Mark Brown)
- Bug has existed since 2018, present in all stable trees
- Affects real hardware (Bay Trail tablets/laptops)
- Same bug pattern confirmed in sibling driver (bytcr_rt5651)
- No dependencies, self-contained fix

AGAINST backporting:
- No user-reported symptoms (found by code inspection)
- Minor context conflict possible on older stable trees (trivially
  resolvable)

**Step 9.2: Stable Rules Checklist**
1. Obviously correct and tested? **YES** — reviewed by Intel, symmetric
   cleanup pattern
2. Fixes a real bug? **YES** — clock resource leak on error path
3. Important issue? **YES** — resource leak affecting power management
   on real devices
4. Small and contained? **YES** — 2 lines, single file, single function
5. No new features or APIs? **YES** — purely a bug fix
6. Can apply to stable? **YES** — clean or trivial fuzz

**Step 9.3: Exception Categories**
Not an exception case — this is a straightforward bug fix.

**Step 9.4: Decision**
This is a textbook stable-worthy fix: tiny, obviously correct, fixes a
real resource leak in a driver used on real hardware, with expert
review. The risk is near zero.
