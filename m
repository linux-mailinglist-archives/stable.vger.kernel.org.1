I'm not sure what count or magic number you are referring to.

AFAIU the issue is that ceph_update_snap_trace() expects to be called
with "p" pointing at ceph_mds_snap_realm encoding.  In the case that is
being fixed it gets called with "p" pointing at "split_inos" array (and
"split_realms" array following that).  The exact check that throws it
off (whether ceph_decode_need() or something else) is irrelevant -- we
are already toasted by then.  In the worst case no check could fire and
ceph_update_snap_trace() could interpret the bogus array data as
a valid ceph_mds_snap_realm with who knows what consequences...

Thanks,

                Ilya
