Sorry, I didn't mean to exclude you. I hadn't realized the
fs-writeback.c file had maintainers/reviewers listed for it. I'll make
sure to cc you next time.

The implications of 0c58a97f919c (eg clearing folio writeback only
when the server has completed writeback instead of clearing writeback
and returning immediately) had some analysis and discussion in this
prior thread [1]. Copying/pasting a snippet from the cover letter:

"With removing the temp page, writeback state is now only cleared on the di=
rty
page after the server has written it back to disk. This may take an
indeterminate amount of time. As well, there is also the possibility of
malicious or well-intentioned but buggy servers where writeback may in the
worst case scenario, never complete. This means that any
folio_wait_writeback() on a dirty page belonging to a FUSE filesystem needs=
 to
be carefully audited.

In particular, these are the cases that need to be accounted for:
* potentially deadlocking in reclaim, as mentioned above
* potentially stalling sync(2)
* potentially stalling page migration / compaction

This patchset adds a new mapping flag, AS_WRITEBACK_INDETERMINATE, which
filesystems may set on its inode mappings to indicate that writeback
operations may take an indeterminate amount of time to complete. FUSE will =
set
this flag on its mappings. This patchset adds checks to the critical parts =
of
reclaim, sync, and page migration logic where writeback may be waited on.

Please note the following:
* For sync(2), waiting on writeback will be skipped for FUSE, but this has =
no
  effect on existing behavior. Dirty FUSE pages are already not guaranteed =
to
  be written to disk by the time sync(2) returns (eg writeback is cleared o=
n
  the dirty page but the server may not have written out the temp page to d=
isk
  yet). If the caller wishes to ensure the data has actually been synced to
  disk, they should use fsync(2)/fdatasync(2) instead.
* AS_WRITEBACK_INDETERMINATE does not indicate that the folios should never=
 be
  waited on when in writeback. There are some cases where the wait is
  desirable. For example, for the sync_file_range() syscall, it is fine to
  wait on the writeback since the caller passes in a fd for the operation."

That was from v6 of the patchset and some things were changed between
that and the final version landed in v8 [2] (most notably, changing
AS_WRITEBACK_INDETERMINATE to AS_WRITEBACK_MAY_DEADLOCK_ON_RECLAIM and
dropping the sync + page migration skips), but I think that analysis
of what cases need to be accounted for / audited remains the same. I
don't think there are any places beyond those 3 listed above that have
a core intrinsic dependency on folio writeback being cleared cleanly
(eg without any involvement of an untrusted fuse server).

For the fsync() and truncate() examples you mentioned, I don't think
it's an issue that these now wait for the server to finish the I/O and
hang if the server doesn't. I think it's actually more correct
behavior than what we had with temp pages, eg imo these actually ought
to wait for the writeback to have been completed by the server. If the
server is malicious / buggy and fsync/truncate hangs, I think that's
fine given that fsync/truncate is initiated by the user on a specific
file descriptor (as opposed to the generic sync()) (and imo it should
hang if it can't actually be executed correctly because the server is
malfunctioning).

As for why this sync user regression has surfaced and now needs to be
addressed, I don't think it's because there's a whack-a-mole game
where we're ad-hoc having to patch up places we didn't realize could
be broken by folio writeback potentially hanging. The original
patchset [1] contained patches that addressed the sync and compaction
case (eg maintaining the original behavior that the temp pages had),
so I don't think this is something that was missed. These patches were
dropped because in the discussion in [1], they seemed pointless to
mitigate / guard against when there already exists other ways
migration/sync could be stalled by a malicious/buggy fuse server. What
I missed was that it's more common than I had thought for
well-intentioned servers to not correctly implement writeback
handling, and that even if it's userspace's "fault", it's still
considered a kernel regression if buggy code previously sufficed but
now doesn't.

Thanks,
Joanne
