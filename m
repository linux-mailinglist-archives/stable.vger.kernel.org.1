Yeah, I realised after I sent out the series that this may not be the
case. I was under the impression that cancelling a command would discard
the data in the FIFO (e.g. when starting the next command) but that was
probably an error in my mental model.

Do you see any way to discard the FIFO in the docs you have access to?

Exactly, there is data there according to the FIFO status, but I
erroneously interpreted it as a it would be discarded (e.g. when
starting the next command).

Indeed. I may implicitly be relying on the absence of hardware flow
control as well so that waiting for one character to be sent is what
makes this work.

I spent too much time trying to reverse engineer this hw over the
weekend and wanted to get this out as a counter proposal as it indicated
that we may be able to find a smaller fix. The series addresses the
serial getty issues, but as I mentioned yesterday there is some
interaction with the console left to be resolved before this can be an
alternative.

If it wasn't for the hard lockup I would have sent the whole thing as
an RFC.
