PEACE BE WITH YOU,

Receiving this message might sound as a surprise to you, please do
accept it as a blessing from God made possible through a woman (widow)
with a good and sincere heart towards the poor orphans. Through these
projects millions will be positively touched as with God nothing is
impossible. I have this strong desire to help the poor orphans
suffering each day, but this dream cannot be realised as a result of
my health, which does not improve, hence I do not know whether I will
survive having undergone different surgical operations, which has kept
me hospitalized. Right now, life gives me no choice, but to answer the
call (death); my prayers each day is to have a place in Heaven. I have
suffered a lot as a result of this incurable sickness (terminal
cancer)! Above all, I do not have a child as a result of my sterility.

The only help I need from you at this point is to be in constant
prayers with me as I believe you have an open heart towards the poor
orphans and do believe in GOD. I would be so much happy to see that my
funds (Eight million Five Hundred United State Dollars) 8.5 Million
USD are properly used to help the less privileged etc before leaving
this world as this will be a great relieve for me and my soul. This is
a huge responsibility, but I pray that God gives you the strength to
handle it. You will also be highly recompensated.

Therefore, I want you to receive the money and take 30% to take care
of yourself and family while 70% should be used basically on
humanitarian purposes mostly to orphanages, Motherless babies home,
less privileged and disable citizens and widows around the world.

Once I get your reply, I will put you in contact with the bank in
charge of the transaction in order to start all necessary procedures
so as to enable you to have possession of my funds as soon as possible
before my next surgical operations.

I looking forward to reading from you.( mirabelvicent01@gmail.com )

Mrs. Mirabel Vicent..
