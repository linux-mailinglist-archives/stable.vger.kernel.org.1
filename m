Hello,

 How are you? Is this your personal or professional email address? I'm a Ukrainian who fled the war to Poland for safety after the demise of my  husband. I recently had the opportunity to reach out to you from a refugee camp in Poland with my two kids for repatriation of funds. I have a secret to share with you. I strongly apologize if my method of contacting you does not suit you.

Regards,
Tatiana Perova
