There's a list of affected CPUs from Arm here:

https://developer.arm.com/Arm%20Security%20Center/Spectre-BHB

(obviously only covers their own designs).

So it looks like A510 and A520 should be unaffected too, although I
didn't check exhaustively. It also looks like A715 is affected but the
whitepaper doesn't tell you what version of 'k' to use...

I don't think we should guess. Just say vulnerable.

Hmm. We shouldn't have to guess here as the firmware mitigation is
discoverable. So if it's unavailable and we're running an a CPU which
needs it, then we're vulnerable.
