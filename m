Maybe you meant the link-speed status, that would be volatile based on
link retraining.
Here we are talking about some non-volatile capabilities value no
invalidation needed to their cached variables.>

IMHO, sysfs interface is part of KABI, you change its behavior , you
definitely would break some running binaries. there is alternative
way to avoid re-cooking binaries or waking up administrator to modify
their configuration/script in the deep night. you already got it.
