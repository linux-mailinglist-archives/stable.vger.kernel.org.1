[ Upstream commit 77de62ad3de3967818c3dbe656b7336ebee461d2 ]

Syzkaller reported a refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free warning
in perf_mmap.

The issue is caused by a race condition between a failing mmap() setup
and a concurrent mmap() on a dependent event (e.g., using output
redirection).

In perf_mmap(), the ring_buffer (rb) is allocated and assigned to
event->rb with the mmap_mutex held. The mutex is then released to
perform map_range().

If map_range() fails, perf_mmap_close() is called to clean up.
However, since the mutex was dropped, another thread attaching to
this event (via inherited events or output redirection) can acquire
the mutex, observe the valid event->rb pointer, and attempt to
increment its reference count. If the cleanup path has already
dropped the reference count to zero, this results in a
use-after-free or refcount saturation warning.

Fix this by extending the scope of mmap_mutex to cover the
map_range() call. This ensures that the ring buffer initialization
and mapping (or cleanup on failure) happens atomically effectively,
preventing other threads from accessing a half-initialized or
dying ring buffer.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

This confirms the race scenario. `perf_event_set_output()` acquires
`output_event->mmap_mutex` and then calls `ring_buffer_get()` which
increments the refcount. If the mmap_mutex was released after
`perf_mmap_rb()` set `event->rb` but before cleanup on `map_range()`
failure, another thread can observe `event->rb` and attempt to get the
ring buffer.

## Analysis

### 1. COMMIT MESSAGE ANALYSIS
The commit clearly describes a **race condition** leading to a **use-
after-free** and **refcount saturation warning** in `perf_mmap()`. It
was:
- **Reported by**: kernel test robot (syzkaller-like automated testing)
- **Signed-off by**: Peter Zijlstra (Intel), the perf subsystem
  maintainer
- **Link to report**: Provided via `Closes:` tag

### 2. CODE CHANGE ANALYSIS
The fix is **purely a scope change** - it extends the existing
`scoped_guard(mutex, &event->mmap_mutex)` to cover the `map_range()`
call and associated cleanup. Specifically:

**Before**: The mutex was released at line 7191 (closing brace of
`scoped_guard`), then `vm_flags_set()`, `mapped()` callback, and
`map_range()` all ran without the mutex. If `map_range()` failed and
`perf_mmap_close()` was called, a concurrent thread could race in
between.

**After**: All of `vm_flags_set()`, `mapped()`, `map_range()`, and
`perf_mmap_close()` (on failure) run inside the `scoped_guard`, closing
the race window.

The race scenario:
1. Thread A: acquires `mmap_mutex`, allocates rb, assigns `event->rb`,
   releases mutex
2. Thread B: acquires `mmap_mutex`, sees valid `event->rb`, calls
   `ring_buffer_get()` (refcount increment)
3. Thread A: `map_range()` fails, calls `perf_mmap_close()` which drops
   refcount to 0
4. Thread B: now holds a reference to a freed ring buffer → UAF

### 3. CLASSIFICATION
- **Bug type**: Race condition → use-after-free / refcount corruption
- **Severity**: HIGH - UAF is a security-class bug (exploitable from
  userspace via perf syscall)
- **Subsystem**: perf/core - widely used, security-sensitive subsystem

### 4. SCOPE AND RISK
- **Size**: 1 file, 38 lines changed (19 insertions, 19 deletions) -
  essentially indentation changes moving code into the existing
  scoped_guard block
- **Risk**: LOW - the fix simply holds a mutex for longer, covering
  operations that logically should have been protected. The only risk is
  holding the mutex across `map_range()`, but `map_range()` doesn't take
  any conflicting locks.
- **Regression potential**: Minimal - holding a mutex slightly longer
  might theoretically increase contention, but `perf_mmap()` is not a
  hot path (called during mmap setup, not during data collection)

### 5. USER IMPACT
- perf is used by virtually all Linux deployments for profiling
- The race can be triggered from userspace with concurrent mmap
  operations
- Found by automated fuzzing (kernel test robot), meaning it's reachable

### 6. DEPENDENCIES
- **Requires**: `scoped_guard` for mmap_mutex (commit d23a6dbc0a717, in
  v6.18+) - **present in 6.19.y**
- **Requires**: `map_range()` and `perf_mmap_close()` on failure path
  (commit f74b9f4ba63ff, in v6.17+) - **present in 6.19.y**
- For older stable trees (6.17.y, 6.12.y, etc.), this would need
  adaptation since the `scoped_guard` pattern and `map_range()` function
  may not exist. The underlying race exists but the fix would need to be
  written differently.

### 7. STABILITY
- Signed-off by Peter Zijlstra, the perf maintainer
- Already merged into mainline (v7.0 merge window)
- Clean, minimal change with clear logic

### Verification

- **git log showed** commit 77de62ad3de39 exists and is authored by
  Haocheng Yu, signed by Peter Zijlstra (Intel) - **verified**
- **git merge-base** confirmed the commit is NOT yet in the 6.19.y
  stable tree (HEAD = v6.19.6) - **verified**
- **git merge-base** confirmed prerequisite d23a6dbc0a717 (scoped_guard)
  IS in 6.19.y - **verified**
- **git merge-base** confirmed prerequisite f74b9f4ba63ff (map_range
  fail handling) IS in 6.19.y - **verified**
- **Read of current perf_mmap()** (lines 7145-7215) confirmed the race
  window: scoped_guard closes at line 7191, then map_range() at line
  7210 is unprotected - **verified**
- **Read of perf_event_set_output()** (lines 13320-13389) confirmed
  concurrent path: acquires mmap_mutex, calls ring_buffer_get() on
  output_event's rb - **verified as concurrent accessor**
- **git show --stat** confirmed 1 file changed, 19 insertions/19
  deletions - **verified minimal scope**
- **git tag --contains** confirmed scoped_guard was first in v6.18,
  map_range fix first in v6.17 - older stable trees would need different
  backport approach - **verified**

### Conclusion

This is a textbook stable backport candidate:
- Fixes a **use-after-free** race condition (security-class bug)
- Found by automated testing (reproducible)
- Signed off by the subsystem maintainer
- Minimal, surgical fix (scope extension of existing mutex)
- Low regression risk
- Applies cleanly to 6.19.y (prerequisites present)
- Core subsystem (perf) with broad user impact

**YES**
