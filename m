You are right, really it is a separate improvement or simplification.
Right now, it is not affecting the users and it is not producing any
problem, just a second random address is generated if there is any problem,
and this is not necessary, because there is a random address generated
previously.
When the extra reset was done during binding operation, as we were modifying
the pregenerated random address, the check in usbnet_probe was useless.
Ok, I will split the patch in two to be considered separately, the first
with the important fix and the second with the commented improvement or
clean-up.

I didn't know the related criteria, I will do as you say.

Thank you
