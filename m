This change to blk_queue_may_bounce() in block/blk.h will only affect 
systems with the following configuration:

1. 32-bit ARM architecture
2. Physical DDR memory greater than or equal to 1GB (greater than lowmem 
region )
3. CONFIG_HIGHMEM enabled
4. Virtual memory split of 1GB for kernel and 3GB for userspace OR when 
we cannot map all physical address in lowmem region

Under these conditions, the logic for buffer bouncing is relevant 
because the kernel may need to handle memory above the low memory 
threshold, which is typical for highmem-enabled 32-bit systems with 
large RAM. On other architectures or configurations, this code path will 
not be exercised.
