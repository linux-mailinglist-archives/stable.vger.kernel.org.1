Apparently not. I added the sound maintainers just to be sure they are
aware of this.

Unless the sound maintainers come up with something, we most likely need
a bisection from you to resolve this.

In case you want to perform a bisection, this guide I'm currently
working on might help:

https://www.leemhuis.info/files/misc/How%20to%20bisect%20a%20Linux%20kernel%20regression%20%e2%80%94%20The%20Linux%20Kernel%20documentation.html

No, this thread (for now) is enough.
