It makes giving back the TD depend on a future event we can't guarantee.

I still think it better fits the spurious success case.
It's not an error mid TD, it's a spurious success event sent by host
after a completion (error) event for the last TRB in the TD.

Making this change to error_mid_td code also makes that code more
confusing and harder to follow.

We did get an event for the last TRB in the TD, so in normal cases
this TD should be considered complete, and given back.

I don't think the controller has any reason to touch data buffers at
this stage either. Can't recall any iommu/dma issues related to this.

For the short transfer case this is more valid concern. Here we give
back the TD after an event mid TD, and we know hardware might still
walk the rest of the TD. It shouldn't touch data buffers either as
short transfer indicates all data has been written.

This sounds reasonable, makes sense to keep the software dequeue
pointer where hardware last reported its position. Currently we
advance it to where we assume hardware will be next.

But this is a separate project.
Might need some work around in the driver.

Thanks
