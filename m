Indeed, I would say the way to go down that route would be to echo what 
we do for "iommus", and defer probing the entire host controller driver 
until the targets of an "iommu-map" are either present or assumed to 
never be appearing. (And of course an ACPI equivalent for that would be 
tricky...)

However, even that isn't necessarily the full solution, as just as it's 
not really appropriate for PCI to force ACS without knowing whether an 
IOMMU is actually present to make it meaningful, it's also not strictly 
appropriate for an IOMMU driver to request ACS globally without knowing 
that it actually serves any relevant PCIe devices. Even in the ideal 
scenario, I think the point of actually knowing is still a bit too late 
for the current API design:

   pci_device_add
     pci_init_capabilities
       pci_acs_init
         pci_enable_acs
     device_add
       iommu_bus_notifier
         iommu_probe_device
           //logically, request ACS for dev here

(at the moment, iommu_probe_device() will actually end up calling into 
the same of_iommu_configure()->pci_request_acs() path, but the plan is 
still to eventually shorten and streamline that.)

I guess we might want to separate the actual ACS enablement from the 
basic capability init, or at least perhaps just call pci_enable_acs() 
again after the IOMMU notifier may have changed the policy?

Thanks,
Robin.
