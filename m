Thanks for letting us know that the audio issue affects sdm845 as well
(I don't seem to hit it on sc8280xp and the X13s).

The ECANCELLED regression has now been fixed, but the audio issue
remains to be addressed (I think Bjorn has done some preliminary
investigation).

There is also a NULL-deref in an MHI path that is triggered by the
in-kernel pd-mapper for which Chris has posted a workaround here:
