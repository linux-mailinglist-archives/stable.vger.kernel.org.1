[ Upstream commit c78c2d0903183a41beb90c56a923e30f90fa91b9 ]

I observed the following evidence of a memory leak while running xfs/399
from the xfs fsck test suite (edited for brevity):

XFS (sde): Metadata corruption detected at xfs_attr_shortform_verify_struct.part.0+0x7b/0xb0 [xfs], inode 0x1172 attr fork
XFS: Assertion failed: ip->i_af.if_u1.if_data == NULL, file: fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_inode_fork.c, line: 315

This newly-added assertion checks that there aren't any incore data
structures hanging off the incore fork when we're trying to reset its
contents.  From the call trace, it is evident that iget was trying to
construct an incore inode from the ondisk inode, but the attr fork
verifier failed and we were trying to undo all the memory allocations
that we had done earlier.

The three assertions in xfs_ifork_zap_attr check that the caller has
already called xfs_idestroy_fork, which clearly has not been done here.
As the zap function then zeroes the pointers, we've effectively leaked
the memory.

The shortest change would have been to insert an extra call to
xfs_idestroy_fork, but it makes more sense to bundle the _idestroy_fork
call into _zap_attr, since all other callsites call _idestroy_fork
immediately prior to calling _zap_attr.  IOWs, it eliminates one way to
fail.

Note: This change only applies cleanly to 2ed5b09b3e8f, since we just
reworked the attr fork lifetime.  However, I think this memory leak has
existed since 0f45a1b20cd8, since the chain xfs_iformat_attr_fork ->
xfs_iformat_local -> xfs_init_local_fork will allocate
ifp->if_u1.if_data, but if xfs_ifork_verify_local_attr fails,
xfs_iformat_attr_fork will free i_afp without freeing any of the stuff
hanging off i_afp.  The solution for older kernels I think is to add the
missing call to xfs_idestroy_fork just prior to calling kmem_cache_free.

Found by fuzzing a.sfattr.hdr.totsize = lastbit in xfs/399.

[ backport note: did not include refactoring of xfs_idestroy_fork into
xfs_ifork_zap_attr, simply added the missing call as suggested in the
commit for backports ]
