Right but how would you know this if you were unable to look at what's
inside cxacru_upload_firmware()? That's basically what is happening with
clang, it is only able to look at cxacru_heavy_init().

If a static checker has the ability to see the NULL passed to
cxacru_upload_firmware() from cxacru_heavy_init(), I would expect it to
notice the identical conditions but point taken :)

Wouldn this be sufficient to avoid such a situation?

I turned this warning on in 5.3 in commit 3a61925e91ba ("kbuild: Enable
-Wuninitialized"), so it is already enabled and it has found many, many
legitimate instances in doing so, just go run 'git log
--grep=Wuninitialized' or 'git log --grep=Wsometimes-uninitialized' in
the kernel sources. While there have been other places in the kernel
where this warning has been falsely triggered such as here, I have
rarely received pushback from maintainers on fixes to silence them
because the majority of them are legitimate (and the false positive
fixes usually result in more robust code). For example, the
strengthening of the warning in clang-21 resulted in what I would
consider legitimate fixes:

Yes, I agree that it is not complex or hard to understand, so I would
rather not refactor it, but I do need this fixed so that allmodconfig
builds (which enable -Werror by default) with clang-21 do not break.
Won't Android eventually hit this when they get a newer compiler?

As far as I understand it, clang adds "noundef" to function parameters
when lowering to LLVM IR, which codifies that passing an uninitialized
value is UB. I suspect that cxacru_upload_firmware() gets inlined so
that ends up not mattering in this case but it could in others.

While '-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero' does "solve" the UB issue, I see it
more of a mitigation against missed initializations, not as a
replacement for ensuring variables are consistently initialized, as zero
might not be the expected initialization. Since that is the default for
the kernel when compilers support it, why not just take this patch with
that fixup above to make it consistent? I would be happy to send a v2 if
you would be okay with it.

Cheers,
Nathan
