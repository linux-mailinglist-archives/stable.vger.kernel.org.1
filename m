I didn't realise you were also using a display/dock. Bjorn mentioned
that he has noticed issues with one of his monitors (e.g. built-in hub
reenumerating repeatedly iirc) which may be related.

I see these pairs of identical notification when connecting the stock
charger to one of the ports directly, and I noticed that they repeat
every 90 seconds here. After plugging and unplugging a bunch of devices
I think they stopped at one point, but they were there again after a
reboot.

So there's something going on with the PMIC GLINK firmware or driver on
the X13s. I did not see these repeated messages on the T14s with just a
charger (and I don't have a dock to test with).

Just so I understand you correctly here, you're no longer seeing the
repeated uevents with this patch? Both when using a dock and when using
a charger directly?

Did it help with the display flickering too? Was that only on the
external display?

Thanks for testing.
