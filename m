Hi Ted,

Oh, so meanwhile it got even worse than I used to imagine :-) Thanks for 
pointing out.

Certainly cosmic rays is a possibility, but based on previous episodes 
I'd still rather bet on a more usual "subtle interaction" problem, 
either exact same or some similar to [1].
I even tried to run an existing test for this particular case as 
described in [2] but it is not too user-friendly and somehow exits 
abnormally without actually doing any interesting work. I'll get back to 
it later when I have some time.

Well, unless e.g. some modified sectors start being flushed to random 
wrong offsets, like in [1] above, or something similar.

Yes. That was intentional - for better compatibility with even more 
ancient stuff. Maybe time has come to reconsider the approach though.

Absolutely. I was really amazed when I realized that :-)
It saved me days or even weeks of unnecessary verification work.

True. Generally I try to follow that, as much as appears possible.
It is sad a direct communication end-user-to-developer for solving 
issues is becoming increasingly problematic here.
Anyway, thank you for friendly speech, useful hints and good references!

Regards,

Nick
