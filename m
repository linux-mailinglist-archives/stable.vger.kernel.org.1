I think you mentioned in an earlier version of the patch that the
USB controller could in theory be built into a Thunderbolt-attached
device and that you wouldn't want to apply the quirk in that case.

Yet this patch doesn't seem to check for that possibility.

I guess in the affected systems, the USB controller is directly
below the Root Port.  The pcie_find_root_port() function you're
using here will walk up the hierarchy until it finds the Root Port,
i.e. it's specifically for the case where there are switches between
the USB controller and Root Port (which I think you want to exclude).
I would have expected that you just call pci_upstream_bridge(dev) once
and check whether the returned device is a PCI_EXP_TYPE_ROOT_PORT.

I'm also wondering why you're not invoking pci_d3cold_disable() with
the USB controller's device (instead of the Root Port).  Setting
no_d3cold on the USB controller should force all upstream bridges
into D0.

Perhaps the reason you're not doing this is because the xhci_hcd driver
might have called pci_d3cold_disable() as part of a quirk and the
unconditional pci_d3cold_enable() on resume might clobber that?

Thanks,

Lukas
