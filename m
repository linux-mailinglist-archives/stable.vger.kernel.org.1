I don't understand what's special about tmpfs.  The only reason the
builtin "ima_tcb" policy includes a "dont_measure" tmpfs rule is
because the initramfs doesn't support xattrs.

A read-only filesystem (squashfs) as the lower filesystem obviously
does not need to be re-evaluated.

With the "audit" and perhaps "measure" rule examples, the policy can at
least be finer grained.

I'm not aware of anyone else looking into it.
