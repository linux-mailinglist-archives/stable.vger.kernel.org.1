This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    usb: dwc: ep0: Update request status in dwc3_ep0_stall_restart

to my usb git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git
in the usb-next branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will also be merged in the next major kernel release
during the merge window.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: usb: dwc: ep0: Update request status in dwc3_ep0_stall_restart

Current implementation blocks the running operations when Plug-out and
Plug-In is performed continuously, process gets stuck in
dwc3_thread_interrupt().

Code Flow:

	CPU1

	->Gadget_start
	->dwc3_interrupt
	->dwc3_thread_interrupt
	->dwc3_process_event_buf
	->dwc3_process_event_entry
	->dwc3_endpoint_interrupt
	->dwc3_ep0_interrupt
	->dwc3_ep0_inspect_setup
	->dwc3_ep0_stall_and_restart

By this time if pending_list is not empty, it will get the next request
on the given list and calls dwc3_gadget_giveback which will unmap request
and call its complete() callback to notify upper layers that it has
completed. Currently dwc3_gadget_giveback status is set to -ECONNRESET,
whereas it should be -ESHUTDOWN based on condition if not dwc->connected
is true.
