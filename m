No, I *think* correct API usage is supposed to be: If one uses 
i915_vma_pin_iomap() for CPU access, then one should call 
i915_vma_flush_writes() after CPU writes are done - presumably as a 
barrier to make sure writes are visible before proceeding.

If that is correct, the I noticed problem (or I am missing something), 
that i915_vma_flush_writes only does something for the one of the three 
ways i915_vma_pin_iomap() can set up the CPU visible mapping (the 
ggtt->iomap path).

The i915_gem_object_lmem_io_map() path, relevant on dgfx, has no 
flushing. Maybe it does need it due WC, or maybe flushing the 
write-combine buffers would still be needed.

And the i915_gem_object_pin_map() path is also WC and in theory there is 
the corresponding __i915_gem_object_flush_map().

Don't know, maybe I am indeed missing something.

But for instance if __i915_gem_object_flush_map() *was* called from 
i915_vma_flush_writes(), and the latter *was* called after dpt_bind_vma 
does its thing, then notice how obj->mm.dirty *would* be set by that 
helper. Removing the need for this patch.

So perhaps i915_vma_flush_writes() should just dirty the object, *if* 
the idea is to be called after CPU writes. And perhaps it should call 
i915_gem_object_flush_map *if* the method of mmaping was other than 
ggtt. But the information would have to be recorded first, probably same 
as the i915_gem_object_pin_map() path records it in the bit 0 of the 
vma->iomap pointer.

Yes definitely wasn't suggesting to do it in this patch.

Yeah it is fine. I assumed someone else would r-b but I can too.
