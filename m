6.1-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Jakub Kicinski <kuba@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit d2f5c68e3f7157e874a759e382a5eaffa775b869 ]

driver.rst had a historical form of list of common problems.
In the age os Sphinx and rendered documentation it's better
to use the more usual title + text format.

This will allow us to render kdoc into the output more naturally.

No changes to the actual text.
