The quilt patch titled
     Subject: mm/vmalloc: do not output a spurious warning when huge vmalloc() fails
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-vmalloc-do-not-output-a-spurious-warning-when-huge-vmalloc-fails.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into the mm-hotfixes-stable branch
of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Subject: mm/vmalloc: do not output a spurious warning when huge vmalloc() fails
Date: Mon, 5 Jun 2023 21:11:07 +0100

In __vmalloc_area_node() we always warn_alloc() when an allocation
performed by vm_area_alloc_pages() fails unless it was due to a pending
fatal signal.

However, huge page allocations instigated either by vmalloc_huge() or
__vmalloc_node_range() (or a caller that invokes this like kvmalloc() or
kvmalloc_node()) always falls back to order-0 allocations if the huge page
allocation fails.

This renders the warning useless and noisy, especially as all callers
appear to be aware that this may fallback.  This has already resulted in
at least one bug report from a user who was confused by this (see link).

Therefore, simply update the code to only output this warning for order-0
pages when no fatal signal is pending.
