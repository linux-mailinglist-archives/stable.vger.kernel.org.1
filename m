We’ve previously had issues in this area that turned out to be kernel bugs. We didn’t change anything regarding journal sizes and only a recent kernel upgrade seemed to be relevant.

As this has always just affected one single VM at a time but spread over time my gut feeling is a bit more on the side of “it might be maybe a bug”. As those things tend to be hard/nasty to diagnose I wanted to raise the flag early on to see whether other’s might be having an “aha” moment if they’re experiencing something similar.

This seems to have been extended a few times, but nothing out-of-reality. Looks
fine, but, is this one of the filesystems where you are facing the problem? I'm
surprised this is the root FS, do you have that much IO into the rootFS?

This is worrisome. Your journal size is 10MiB, this can easily keep stalling IO
waiting for log space to be freed, depending on the nature of the machine this
can be easily triggered. I'm curious though how you made this FS, because 2560
is below the minimal log size that xfsprogs allows since (/me goes look
into git log) 2022, xfsprogs 5.15.

FWIW, one of the reasons the minimum journal log size has been increased is the
latency/stalls that happens when waiting for free log space, which is exactly
the symptom you've been seeing.

I'd suggest you to check the xfsprogs commit below if you want more details,
but if this is one of the filesystems where you see the stalls, this might very
well be the cause:

    mkfs: increase the minimum log size to 64MB when possible
