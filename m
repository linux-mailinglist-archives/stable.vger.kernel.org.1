Again, tpm2_get_random() sets a HMAC key once and then uses it multiple
times.

Sure, provided that memcmp() is actually secure here.  So far, it hasn't
been particularly convincing when each argument you've given for it
being secure has been incorrect.

But I do see that each call to tpm_buf_check_hmac_response() is paired
with a call to tpm_buf_append_hmac_session() which generates a fresh
nonce.  That nonce is then sent to the other endpoint (the one that
claims to be a TPM) and then implicitly becomes part of the response
message (but is not explicitly transmitted back in it).  That may be the
real reason: messages are guaranteed to not be repeated, so a MAC timing
attack can't be done.  Do you agree that is the actual reason?
