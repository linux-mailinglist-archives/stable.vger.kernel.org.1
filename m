The read of master->slaves is outside of the slaves_lock critical
section(s) in teql_master_xmit(). This is possibly the nub of this issue.

I see what you are saying regarding the free not occurring at step 4
because CPU A is in an RCU read-side critical section.

But once CPU A has assigned master->slaves as q (again) it exits
the RCU read-side critical section. Then the free of q can occur.
And master->slaves will point to memory that has been been freed.

So the access to q is safe when teql_master_xmit is invoked, due to RCU
protecting object lifetime.  But it is unsafe when teql_master_xmit is
invoked again because by then master->slaves is a dangling pointer.
