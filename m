FWIW, I would also not be surprised if the old code would also fail
fuzzing in other ways, like keyctl() being used to directly manipulate
the keyrings from underneath what fs/crypto/ assumes.  I remember at
least considering that scenario when adding this code years ago, but I
think the reasoning was quite subtle and I may have missed something.

The 'struct key' keyrings just have a lot of obscure sharp corners.
Whereas simple lists, hash tables, etc. are much easier to evaluate.
