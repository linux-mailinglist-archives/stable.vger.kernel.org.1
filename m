commit 28eceeda130f5058074dd007d9c59d2e8bc5af2e upstream.

When a directory is moved to a different directory, some filesystems
(udf, ext4, ocfs2, f2fs, and likely gfs2, reiserfs, and others) need to
update their pointer to the parent and this must not race with other
operations on the directory. Lock the directories when they are moved.
Although not all filesystems need this locking, we perform it in
vfs_rename() because getting the lock ordering right is really difficult
and we don't want to expose these locking details to filesystems.
