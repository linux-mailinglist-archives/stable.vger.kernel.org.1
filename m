I was planning to send a PR to Linus with a quirk for MSI GS66 Stealth
11UG, and apparently this bug report would add two additional MSI
entries. This is becoming quickly a maintenance hell.

For Lenovo, I also added patch that will categorically disable irqs for
all with vendor "LENOVO" because there was already six entries, and I
got patch for 7th.

Now we at least know that IRQs TPMs are somewhat broken so it is time to
make decisions to make this converge to something.

I see two long-standing options:

A. Move from deny list to allow list when considering using IRQs. This
   can be supplemented with a kernel command-line parameter to enforce
   IRQs and ignore the allow list (and IRQ storm detection provides
   additional measure in case you try to enforce)
B. Change deny list to match only vendors for the time being. This can
   be supplemented with a allow list that is processed after the deny
   list for models where IRQs are known to work.

This would the implementation of (B):

static const struct dmi_system_id tpm_tis_dmi_table[] =3D {
	{
		.callback =3D tpm_tis_disable_irq,
		.matches =3D {
			DMI_MATCH(DMI_SYS_VENDOR, "Framework"),
		},
	},
	{
		.callback =3D tpm_tis_disable_irq,
		.ident =3D "MSI GS66 Stealth 11UG",
		.matches =3D {
			DMI_MATCH(DMI_SYS_VENDOR, "Micro-Star International Co., Ltd."),
		},
	},
	{
		.callback =3D tpm_tis_disable_irq,
		.matches =3D {
			DMI_MATCH(DMI_SYS_VENDOR, "LENOVO"),
		},
	},
	{
		.callback =3D tpm_tis_disable_irq,
		.matches =3D {
			DMI_MATCH(DMI_SYS_VENDOR, "TUXEDO"),
		},
	},
	{
		.callback =3D tpm_tis_disable_irq,
		.matches =3D {
			DMI_MATCH(DMI_SYS_VENDOR, "AAEON"),
		},
	},
	{}
};
