6.12-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Michal Pecio <michal.pecio@gmail.com>

commit 474538b8dd1cd9c666e56cfe8ef60fbb0fb513f4 upstream.

Stop Endpoint command on an already stopped endpoint fails and may be
misinterpreted as a known hardware bug by the completion handler. This
results in an unnecessary delay with repeated retries of the command.

Avoid queuing this command when endpoint state flags indicate that it's
stopped or halted and the command will fail. If commands are pending on
the endpoint, their completion handlers will process cancelled TDs so
it's done. In case of waiting for external operations like clearing TT
buffer, the endpoint is stopped and cancelled TDs can be processed now.

This eliminates practically all unnecessary retries because an endpoint
with pending URBs is maintained in Running state by the driver, unless
aforementioned commands or other operations are pending on it. This is
guaranteed by xhci_ring_ep_doorbell() and by the fact that it is called
every time any of those operations completes.

The only known exceptions are hardware bugs (the endpoint never starts
at all) and Stream Protocol errors not associated with any TRB, which
cause an endpoint reset not followed by restart. Sounds like a bug.

Generally, these retries are only expected to happen when the endpoint
fails to start for unknown/no reason, which is a worse problem itself,
and fixing the bug eliminates the retries too.

All cases were tested and found to work as expected. SET_DEQ_PENDING
was produced by patching uvcvideo to unlink URBs in 100us intervals,
which then runs into this case very often. EP_HALTED was produced by
restarting 'cat /dev/ttyUSB0' on a serial dongle with broken cable.
EP_CLEARING_TT by the same, with the dongle on an external hub.
