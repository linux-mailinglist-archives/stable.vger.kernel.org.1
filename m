[ Upstream commit 74e8409821ac8cda70bf23eb593f2c7f6e3b5a2f ]

The HDA drivers were moved to sound/hda/... so update a Documentation
reference that still pointed to the old location.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## Phase 1: Commit Message Forensics
Record 1.1: Subsystem `ALSA: doc: cs35l56`; action verb `Update`;
intent: correct a stale documentation path to the HDA driver source.

Record 1.2: Tags present in supplied message: `Signed-off-by: Richard
Fitzgerald <rf@opensource.cirrus.com>`, `Link: https://patch.msgid.link/
20260511104148.36382-1-rf@opensource.cirrus.com`, `Signed-off-by:
Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>`. No `Fixes:`, `Reported-by:`, `Tested-
by:`, `Reviewed-by:`, `Acked-by:`, or `Cc: stable`.

Record 1.3: The body says the HDA drivers moved to `sound/hda/...`,
leaving this documentation reference pointing at the old
`sound/pci/hda/...` location. Symptom is incorrect documentation only;
no runtime failure, crash, data corruption, or security impact is
described.

Record 1.4: This is not a hidden runtime bug fix. It is a direct
documentation correction.

## Phase 2: Diff Analysis
Record 2.1: One file changed: `Documentation/sound/codecs/cs35l56.rst`,
1 insertion and 1 deletion. No functions modified. Scope: single-file
documentation-only surgical change.

Record 2.2: Before: HDA users were pointed to
`sound/pci/hda/cs35l56_hda.c`. After: they are pointed to
`sound/hda/codecs/side-codecs/cs35l56_hda.c`.

Record 2.3: Bug category: documentation correctness fix. Verified
current tree has `sound/hda/codecs/side-codecs/cs35l56_hda.c`;
`sound/pci/hda` does not exist in this checkout.

Record 2.4: Fix quality is obvious and minimal. Regression risk is
runtime zero, but backport targeting matters: applying it to older trees
where the driver is still under `sound/pci/hda` would make the
documentation wrong.

## Phase 3: Git History Investigation
Record 3.1: `git blame` shows the stale documentation line was
introduced by `088fb4ee17fc4` (`ALSA: doc: cs35l56: Add information
about Cirrus Logic CS35L54/56/57`). The line became stale when
`6014e9021b28e` moved HDA codec drivers into `sound/hda/codecs`.

Record 3.2: No `Fixes:` tag is present, so there was no Fixes target to
follow.

Record 3.3: Recent file history shows only CS35L56 documentation
updates. Related source movement is `6014e9021b28e`, which renamed
`sound/pci/hda/cs35l56_hda.c` to `sound/hda/codecs/side-
codecs/cs35l56_hda.c`.

Record 3.4: Author Richard Fitzgerald has multiple recent CS35L56/HDA-
related commits in this subsystem, including documentation and HDA
driver fixes.

Record 3.5: Dependency identified: this patch is correct only in trees
that already contain the HDA move commit `6014e9021b28e`.

## Phase 4: Mailing List And External Research
Record 4.1: `b4 am` using message ID
`20260511104148.36382-1-rf@opensource.cirrus.com` found a single patch
submission and reported no newer revision. Direct `WebFetch` to
lore/patch.msgid.link was blocked by Anubis, but `b4` retrieved the
mbox.

Record 4.2: `b4 dig -c` could not be run for the candidate commit
because no candidate commit hash was supplied and the commit was not
found on checked named branches searched. `b4 am` verified author DKIM
signatures and the patch metadata. `b4 dig -c 6014e9021b28e -w` verified
the prerequisite move patch was an ALSA HDA series sent to `linux-sound`
and relevant HDA/Cirrus recipients.

Record 4.3: No bug report, syzbot report, crash report, or user report
is linked.

Record 4.4: Candidate is standalone as a documentation update, but
semantically depends on the prior source-tree move.

Record 4.5: Web searches and local pending branch searches found no
stable-specific discussion for this exact documentation patch.

## Phase 5: Code Semantic Analysis
Record 5.1: No functions modified; documentation text only.

Record 5.2: No callers; this is not runtime code.

Record 5.3: No callees; no allocations, locks, I/O, or side effects.

Record 5.4: No userspace-triggerable kernel execution path. Impact is
limited to readers of the documentation.

Record 5.5: Search found the old path only in
`Documentation/sound/codecs/cs35l56.rst` among `.rst` files checked.

## Phase 6: Stable Tree Analysis
Record 6.1: Tag containment shows the documentation exists from
`v6.13+`; the HDA move exists from `v6.17+`. Therefore the stale-path
documentation issue exists only in trees containing both, i.e.
approximately `v6.17+` and later.

Record 6.2: `git apply --check` confirms the patch applies cleanly to
the current `7.0.y` tree. Backport difficulty is trivial for affected
trees, but it must not be applied to trees where the HDA driver still
lives under `sound/pci/hda`.

Record 6.3: No related stable fix for this exact path correction was
found in local pending branches.

## Phase 7: Subsystem And Maintainer Context
Record 7.1: Subsystem is ALSA sound documentation for Cirrus CS35L56
HDA/SoundWire amplifiers. Criticality: peripheral/documentation, not
runtime core.

Record 7.2: Sound documentation and HDA side-codec areas are actively
maintained; recent logs show multiple CS35L56/HDA commits.

## Phase 8: Impact And Risk Assessment
Record 8.1: Affected population: developers, maintainers, integrators,
and users consulting this CS35L56 documentation in kernels where the HDA
source has moved.

Record 8.2: Trigger condition: reading the documentation. Not
triggerable as a kernel runtime fault.

Record 8.3: Failure mode: stale documentation path. Severity LOW, but
documentation fixes are explicitly acceptable stable material due zero
runtime risk.

Record 8.4: Benefit is modest but real for affected trees; risk is very
low if limited to trees with `6014e9021b28e`, but negative for older
trees where the old path is still correct.

## Phase 9: Final Synthesis
Record 9.1: Evidence for backporting: fixes an objectively wrong
documentation reference, one-line contained patch, no runtime regression
risk, applies cleanly to current `7.0.y`, documentation/comment fixes
are an accepted stable exception. Evidence against: no runtime bug, no
important crash/security/corruption impact, and it must be branch-
limited. Unresolved: exact upstream candidate commit hash was not
available locally.

Record 9.2: Stable rules: obviously correct: yes; tested: `b4` says
applies cleanly and local `git apply --check` passed; fixes a real bug:
yes, documentation bug; important runtime issue: no; small and
contained: yes, 1 line; no new feature/API: yes; applies to affected
stable trees: yes, for trees after the HDA move.

Record 9.3: Exception category: documentation fix.

Record 9.4: Decision: backport is appropriate, but only to stable trees
that already contain the HDA source move to `sound/hda/codecs/side-
codecs`. Do not apply to older stable trees where
`sound/pci/hda/cs35l56_hda.c` remains the correct path.

## Verification
- [Phase 1] Parsed supplied commit message and downloaded mbox:
  confirmed subject, author, message ID, and one-line documentation
  rationale.
- [Phase 2] Read `Documentation/sound/codecs/cs35l56.rst`: confirmed old
  path is present.
- [Phase 2] Checked filesystem: confirmed `sound/hda/codecs/side-
  codecs/cs35l56_hda.c` exists and `sound/pci/hda` does not in current
  tree.
- [Phase 3] `git blame -L 35,45`: confirmed stale line came from
  `088fb4ee17fc4`.
- [Phase 3] `git show 6014e9021b28e`: confirmed HDA codecs, including
  `cs35l56_hda.c`, were moved from `sound/pci/hda` to
  `sound/hda/codecs/side-codecs`.
- [Phase 4] `b4 am`: retrieved the patch, found one patch, no newer
  revision, DKIM signed.
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -c <msgid>`: failed because `b4 dig` requires a
  commit-ish, not a message ID.
- [Phase 4] WebFetch to lore/patch.msgid.link: blocked by Anubis.
- [Phase 6] `git tag --contains`: documentation starts at `v6.13+`; HDA
  move starts at `v6.17+`.
- [Phase 6] `git apply --check`: candidate patch applies cleanly to
  current tree.
- [Phase 6] `git ls-tree`: `v6.6`/`v6.12` have old HDA source path and
  no affected doc; `v6.18` has both affected doc and new HDA source
  path.
- UNVERIFIED: Candidate final upstream commit hash, because it was not
  found on searched local named branches and was not provided.
