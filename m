Apart from the actual problem you're fixing, it looks like some of our
bus number resource setup is a little deficient here.  The "43-41" and
"42-41" ranges are bogus and "(null)" doesn't tell us anything useful.

I suppose this is could also be viewed as a resource management
problem.  

Even in the normal hotplug case, we never know what a hot-added
hierarchy will look like, so we hack around it with the compiled-in
DEFAULT_HOTPLUG_BUS_SIZE and the "hpbussize=" kernel parameter.

It would be nice if we could allocate more bus numbers at hot-add (or
link-up) time as needed.  That's hard after drivers have claimed
nearby devices, but in this case there might not be anything nearby.

"Proper" is hiding some important details here.  pwrctrl already
supports powering up and enumerating switches.  I think this refers to
[1], where Mani says the plan is for pwrctrl to power up everything
before the initial bus scan so we can figure out how many buses are
needed.
