[ Upstream commit 45d89a344eb46db9dce851c28e14f5e3c635c251 ]

In the dwc3 core, both system and runtime suspend end up calling
dwc3_suspend_common(). From there, what happens for the PHYs depends on
the USB mode and whether the controller is entering system or runtime
suspend.

HOST mode:
  (1) system suspend on a non-wakeup-capable controller

  The [1] if branch is taken. dwc3_core_exit() is called, which ends up
  calling phy_power_off() and phy_exit(). Those two functions decrease the
  PM runtime count at some point, so they will trigger the PHY runtime
  sleep (assuming the count is right).

  (2) runtime suspend / system suspend on a wakeup-capable controller

  The [1] branch is not taken. dwc3_suspend_common() calls
  phy_pm_runtime_put_sync(). Assuming the ref count is right, the PHY
  runtime suspend op is called.

DEVICE mode:
  dwc3_core_exit() is called on both runtime and system sleep
  unless the controller is already runtime suspended.

OTG mode:
  (1) system suspend : dwc3_core_exit() is called

  (2) runtime suspend : do nothing

In host mode, the code seems to make a distinction between 1) runtime
sleep / system sleep for wakeup-capable controller, and 2) system sleep
for non-wakeup-capable controller, where phy_power_off() and phy_exit()
are only called for the latter. This suggests the PHY is not supposed to
be in a fully powered-off state for runtime sleep and system sleep for
wakeup-capable controller.

Moreover, downstream, cfg_ahb_clk only gets disabled for system suspend.
The clocks are disabled by phy->set_suspend() [2] which is only called
in the system sleep path through dwc3_core_exit() [3].

With that in mind, don't disable the clocks during the femto PHY runtime
suspend callback. The clocks will only be disabled during system suspend
for non-wakeup-capable controllers, through dwc3_core_exit().
