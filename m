[ Upstream commit a28de63356575612954d4e5d5f48a2488f50e16d ]

The Microchip USB3340x ULPI PHY requires a delay when switching to the
high-speed transmitter. See:
    http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/80000645A.pdf
    Module 2 "Device Enumeration Failure with Link IP Systems"

For details on the behavior and fix, refer to the AMD (formerly Xilinx)
forum post: "USB stuck in full speed mode with USB3340 ULPI PHY, ZynqMP."

This patch uses the USB PHY Vendor-ID and Product-ID to detect the
USB3340 PHY and then applies the necessary fix if this PHY is found.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Now I have enough information to complete the full phase-by-phase
analysis.

# Full 9-Phase Analysis

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: Subject line parsing**
- Subsystem: `usb: dwc3:` (DesignWare USB3 controller driver)
- Action verb: "Support" (often hides a bug fix – here it is supporting
  HS negotiation that is broken)
- Record: `usb: dwc3` – "Support" – one-line: enable HS chirp delay
  workaround for Microchip USB3340x ULPI PHY

**Step 1.2: Tag parsing**
- Fixes: (absent – expected for candidate review)
- Reported-by: (absent)
- Tested-by: (absent)
- Reviewed-by: (absent)
- Acked-by: Thinh Nguyen <Thinh.Nguyen@synopsys.com> (the DWC3 subsystem
  maintainer)
- Link: patch.msgid.link to v5 submission
- Cc: stable: absent
- Signed-off-by: author Ingo Rohloff + Greg KH (USB subsystem
  maintainer)
- Record: The dwc3 maintainer explicitly Acked this; Greg KH merged it.
  Strong quality signal.

**Step 1.3: Body analysis**
- Bug described: Microchip USB3340x ULPI PHY fails HS negotiation – USB
  stays stuck in full-speed
- References Microchip erratum doc 80000645A.pdf, Module 2 "Device
  Enumeration Failure with Link IP Systems"
- References AMD/Xilinx forum post "USB stuck in full speed mode with
  USB3340 ULPI PHY, ZynqMP"
- Mechanism: delay needed when switching to the high-speed transmitter
  (TxValid during HS Chirp)
- Record: Real hardware-level bug documented by silicon vendor, with
  user-visible symptom (USB devices don't work at high speed on ZynqMP +
  USB3340 boards).

**Step 1.4: Hidden bug fix detection**
- "Support" often hides a functional fix – the PHY doesn't work without
  this patch on affected boards
- Record: This IS a bug fix presented as hardware enablement. The
  underlying bug is a hardware silicon erratum that requires a software
  workaround (controller-side XCVRDLY bit).

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

**Step 2.1: Inventory**
- `drivers/usb/dwc3/core.c`: +20 lines (new `dwc3_ulpi_setup()` helper +
  one call site)
- `drivers/usb/dwc3/core.h`: +4 lines (new `DWC3_GUSB2PHYCFG_XCVRDLY
  BIT(9)`, new struct field `enable_usb2_transceiver_delay:1`,
  kerneldoc)
- `drivers/usb/dwc3/ulpi.c`: +25 lines (new `dwc3_ulpi_detect_config()`,
  `#include <linux/ulpi/driver.h>`, `USB_VENDOR_MICROCHIP` macro, call
  in `dwc3_ulpi_init()`)
- Total: +49 / -0, contained in 3 files of one driver subdir
- Record: Single-driver surgical change, no cross-subsystem impact.

**Step 2.2: Code flow**
- `dwc3_ulpi_init()`: after registering ULPI interface, now calls
  `dwc3_ulpi_detect_config()` which reads the ULPI PHY vendor/product
  IDs and sets `dwc->enable_usb2_transceiver_delay` only when it sees
  Microchip (0x0424) product 0x0009.
- `dwc3_core_init()`: after ULPI init, calls new `dwc3_ulpi_setup()`
  which, for the specific PHY only, sets `DWC3_GUSB2PHYCFG_XCVRDLY`
  (BIT(9)) on every USB2 port's GUSB2PHYCFG register.
- Record: Default behavior is completely unchanged; the new code path is
  gated by a specific vendor/product ID and by presence of an ULPI PHY
  (`if (!dwc->ulpi) return;`).

**Step 2.3: Bug mechanism class**
- Category (h) Hardware workaround: quirk activated via ULPI
  vendor/product match, writes a controller-side delay bit per the
  Microchip erratum.
- Record: Pure hardware quirk – no locking, no refcount, no allocation
  changes.

**Step 2.4: Fix quality**
- Obviously correct: reads the register, ORs the bit, writes back (per
  erratum's documented workaround)
- Minimal/surgical and tightly gated by vendor+product ID
- Regression risk for any other hardware is essentially zero
  (`enable_usb2_transceiver_delay` only becomes true for one specific
  ULPI PHY)
- Record: Low risk, high confidence.

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

**Step 3.1: Blame**
- The `dwc3_hs_phy_setup()` / `dwc3_phy_setup()` loop structure using
  `num_usb2_ports` was introduced by `921e109c62007` ("usb: dwc3: core:
  Access XHCI address space temporarily to read port info") which is in
  `v6.10-rc1`.
- Record: The per-port iteration model, and therefore the patch's `for
  (index = 0; index < dwc->num_usb2_ports; index++)` construct, cleanly
  matches v6.10.y and newer.

**Step 3.2: Fixes: tag follow-up**
- No Fixes: tag; the bug is a silicon erratum, not a prior kernel commit
- Record: N/A (expected).

**Step 3.3: Related history**
- Prior dwc3 ulpi history (`e5f4ca3fce90a`, `fca3f13810572`,
  `ce722da66d3e9`, `e0082698b6898`, `98112041bcca1`, `88bc9d194ff69`)
  shows the ULPI infrastructure has been in place since v4.x, with the
  `dwc->ulpi_ready` / `dwc3_core_ulpi_init()` flow in place since v4.16.
- Record: Standalone patch – no unlanded prerequisites outside the dwc3
  driver itself.

**Step 3.4: Author**
- Ingo Rohloff (Lauterbach) – embedded/debug tools vendor, not a dwc3
  regular; patch went through 5 revisions to get maintainer acceptance.
- Record: External contributor, but maintainer Ack and Greg KH merge
  provides the quality signal.

**Step 3.5: Dependencies**
- Relies on `dwc->num_usb2_ports` (added v6.10) and the per-port HS PHY
  setup model.
- On the current 7.0 tree it uses `dwc3_readl(dwc->regs, ...)` – this is
  the legacy API; commit `9accc68b1cf0a` renamed the first arg to `dwc`.
  Both forms are functionally identical; any merge conflict with that
  rename is trivial (one-arg swap).
- Record: Applies cleanly to 6.10.y+ stable trees; for 6.1.y/6.6.y
  backport would need to be rewritten to use single-port indexing (not
  just the XHCI-port probing).

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST / EXTERNAL RESEARCH

**Step 4.1: b4 dig**
- `b4 dig -c a28de63356575` → matched thread at `https://lore.kernel.org
  /all/20260305121452.54082-2-ingo.rohloff@lauterbach.com/`
- `b4 dig -a` shows v1 (Feb 24) → v2 (Feb 25) → v3 (Feb 27) → v4 (Mar 3)
  → v5 (Mar 5 — applied)
- v1/v2 used a DT property (`snps,enable_xcvrdly_quirk`) but reviewers
  asked for autodetection; v3 switched to vendor/product-ID detection.
- Record: 5 revisions, significant review feedback addressed, applied
  version is the latest.

**Step 4.2: b4 dig -w / recipients**
- Thread recipients include Thinh Nguyen (dwc3 maintainer), Greg KH,
  linux-usb
- Record: Correct maintainers and list involved; Ack came from the
  maintainer.

**Step 4.3: Bug report**
- External reports referenced in the commit message:
  - Microchip erratum 80000645A ("Device Enumeration Failure with Link
    IP Systems")
  - AMD/Xilinx forum thread about USB stuck in full-speed on ZynqMP
- Record: Verified documented hardware issue affecting a real shipping
  platform (Xilinx/AMD ZynqMP with USB3340 PHY).

**Step 4.4: Series context**
- Mbox shows this is the only patch in the v5 series (1/1); earlier
  versions had a DT binding patch (2/2) that was dropped when approach
  changed to autodetection
- Record: Standalone patch, no missing prerequisites.

**Step 4.5: Stable-list discussion**
- No explicit Cc: stable in the patch, and the maintainer's Ack ("Acked-
  by: Thinh Nguyen ... Thanks, Thinh") did not discuss stable
- Record: No explicit stable nomination, but none is required for
  candidate review.

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1: Key functions**
- New: `dwc3_ulpi_setup()`, `dwc3_ulpi_detect_config()`
- Modified call sites: `dwc3_core_init()`, `dwc3_ulpi_init()`

**Step 5.2: Callers**
- `dwc3_core_init()` is called from `dwc3_probe()` and from runtime
  resume paths – core device bring-up path
- `dwc3_ulpi_init()` is called from `dwc3_core_ulpi_init()` which is
  called from `dwc3_core_init()` only when the HW params indicate a ULPI
  interface
- Record: New code runs only during dwc3 init; not in hot data paths,
  IRQ context, or sleep paths.

**Step 5.3: Callees**
- `dwc3_readl`/`dwc3_writel` (MMIO) – bounded, no allocation, no lock
- Record: Minimal side effects; just register writes.

**Step 5.4: Reachability**
- Path: user boots board → dwc3 probe → `dwc3_core_init()` → (if ULPI)
  `dwc3_ulpi_init()` → register PHY → read vendor/product ID → set flag;
  then `dwc3_ulpi_setup()` applies XCVRDLY bit
- Reachable on every boot on affected ZynqMP/USB3340 boards; inert on
  every other board
- Record: Trigger is "boot with USB3340 ULPI PHY", which is exactly the
  affected population.

**Step 5.5: Similar patterns**
- The dwc3 driver already has many per-quirk bitfields
  (`ulpi_ext_vbus_drv`, `dis_enblslpm_quirk`,
  `dis_u2_freeclk_exists_quirk`, etc.)
- Record: New `enable_usb2_transceiver_delay` fits the existing quirk-
  flag pattern.

## PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AND STABLE TREE ANALYSIS

**Step 6.1: Stable trees containing buggy code**
- The underlying "bug" is a PHY silicon defect that exists in the
  hardware regardless of kernel version. The affected kernel construct
  (`num_usb2_ports`, per-port HS setup) has been present since v6.10.
- Record: 6.10.y, 6.12.y (LTS), 6.14+, 6.16+, 6.17+ are applicable
  targets.

**Step 6.2: Backport complications**
- v6.10.y+: patch applies essentially as-is (minor textual offset
  likely)
- v6.6.y and older: the per-port `num_usb2_ports` model does not exist;
  would need the single-port form (just GUSB2PHYCFG(0)). Still trivially
  doable but requires an adjusted patch.
- The `dwc3_readl` API rename (`9accc68b1cf0a`) is only in 7.0-stream;
  any stable tree older than that uses the same `(dwc->regs, reg)`
  signature this patch writes, so no conflict there.
- Record: Clean apply to recent stable trees; minor rewrite needed for
  older ones.

**Step 6.3: Related fixes already in stable**
- No prior fix for this specific USB3340 issue exists in stable; this is
  the first/only fix
- Record: No duplication concern.

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM AND MAINTAINER CONTEXT

**Step 7.1: Subsystem/criticality**
- Subsystem: `drivers/usb/dwc3/` – DWC3 USB controller driver (used on
  Qualcomm, Xilinx/AMD ZynqMP, Rockchip, Intel, i.MX, TI, etc.)
- Criticality: IMPORTANT (widely deployed, but the fix only affects
  boards with USB3340 ULPI PHY – primarily ZynqMP-based systems)
- Record: Important driver, narrow board-specific impact.

**Step 7.2: Activity**
- Very active subsystem – many recent commits in drivers/usb/dwc3 in the
  past year
- Record: Actively maintained, maintainer is engaged.

## PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

**Step 8.1: Who is affected**
- Users of boards combining a DWC3 controller with a Microchip USB3340
  ULPI PHY (notably AMD/Xilinx ZynqMP UltraScale+ platforms)
- Record: Driver-specific / hardware-specific population; but a real,
  shipping HW combination.

**Step 8.2: Trigger conditions**
- Every boot on affected hardware
- No special privilege needed; just plugging in any USB device
  reproduces the symptom (full-speed instead of high-speed)
- Record: Easy to reproduce – it is the default behavior on affected HW
  without the fix.

**Step 8.3: Failure mode**
- Functional degradation: USB stuck at 12 Mbit/s full-speed instead of
  480 Mbit/s high-speed, plus outright "device enumeration failure" per
  Microchip erratum
- Severity: HIGH (functional breakage of USB HS on affected boards; not
  a crash, but USB effectively doesn't work properly).

**Step 8.4: Risk/benefit**
- Benefit: Restores proper USB HS operation on real shipping hardware
  (ZynqMP + USB3340) — HIGH for affected users, NONE for others.
- Risk: Writes happen only when vendor+product match exactly →
  effectively zero regression risk elsewhere. The new code path is well-
  guarded (`if (!dwc->ulpi) return;` + `if
  (dwc->enable_usb2_transceiver_delay)`).
- Scope: +49 lines, 3 files, one driver.
- Record: Very favorable benefit/risk ratio for the affected population.

## PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Step 9.1: Evidence compilation**

Evidence FOR:
- Fixes a documented silicon erratum (Microchip 80000645A) with a user-
  visible symptom (USB stuck in full-speed)
- Narrowly gated by ULPI vendor+product ID – zero risk to other hardware
- Well-reviewed (5 versions), Acked by subsystem maintainer, merged by
  Greg KH
- Small contained patch (+49 lines, 3 files in one driver)
- Matches the stable rules' explicit "QUIRKS and WORKAROUNDS" exception
- Addresses a real shipping platform (AMD/Xilinx ZynqMP) — not
  theoretical

Evidence AGAINST:
- No Fixes: tag (but: hardware bug, no kernel commit to fix – expected)
- No Cc: stable (expected for candidate review)
- Not described with "fix" language in the subject (author framed it as
  "Support")
- Adds new infrastructure (`dwc3_ulpi_setup`, `dwc3_ulpi_detect_config`,
  new quirk flag) rather than a trivial one-line ID add; some consider
  this "feature-shaped"
- Requires `num_usb2_ports` (v6.10+) for clean apply to older stable
  trees

Unresolved: None material.

**Step 9.2: Stable rules checklist**
1. Obviously correct and tested? YES (small, gated by exact
   vendor/product ID; controller register bit is the vendor-prescribed
   workaround)
2. Real bug? YES (documented silicon erratum, real user reports)
3. Important issue? YES (USB HS broken on affected platforms)
4. Small/contained? YES (+49 lines, 3 files, one driver)
5. No new features/APIs? Borderline – it adds a quirk-detection
   mechanism, but no userspace-visible API or new module parameter;
   internal-only.
6. Applies to stable trees? YES for 6.10+; would need trivial adjustment
   for older

**Step 9.3: Exception category**
- Hardware quirk/workaround for broken device → this is explicitly an
  allowed exception per the stable rules.

**Step 9.4: Decision**
This is a hardware-quirk fix for a real, documented silicon erratum
affecting shipping AMD/Xilinx ZynqMP platforms. The change is strictly
additive, gated by a specific vendor/product ID match, carries
essentially zero regression risk for unaffected systems, was reviewed
through five revisions, and has the DWC3 maintainer's Ack. It directly
fits the "QUIRKS and WORKAROUNDS" exception in the stable kernel rules.

## Verification

- [Phase 1] Parsed tags and body of commit a28de63356575; confirmed
  Acked-by: Thinh Nguyen and Signed-off-by: Greg KH; confirmed
  references to Microchip erratum and Xilinx/AMD forum post.
- [Phase 2] Read the diff and current
  `drivers/usb/dwc3/{core.c,core.h,ulpi.c}`; confirmed only-+ scope
  (+49/0) and gating by `if (!dwc->ulpi)` and `if
  (dwc->enable_usb2_transceiver_delay)`.
- [Phase 3] `git log --oneline master -- drivers/usb/dwc3/ulpi.c` showed
  ULPI infrastructure dates back to v4.16 (`88bc9d194ff69`); `git
  describe --contains 921e109c62007` = `v6.10-rc1~48^2~50` →
  `num_usb2_ports` first appeared in 6.10.
- [Phase 3] `git describe --contains 9accc68b1cf0a` confirmed
  `dwc3_readl` API rename is only in `next-20260205`/7.0-stream, so
  older stable trees still use the signature this patch writes.
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -c a28de63356575` → found lore thread `https://lore.
  kernel.org/all/20260305121452.54082-2-ingo.rohloff@lauterbach.com/`.
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -c a28de63356575 -a` → listed v1..v5 with lore URLs;
  v5 is the applied revision.
- [Phase 4] Read `/tmp/thread.mbox` (saved via `b4 dig -m`): verified
  Acked-by from Thinh Nguyen (dwc3 maintainer) and the changelog v1→v5
  switching from DT property to vendor/product-ID autodetection.
- [Phase 5] Read `dwc3_ulpi_init()` in `drivers/usb/dwc3/ulpi.c` and its
  caller `dwc3_core_ulpi_init()` at `drivers/usb/dwc3/core.c:651-665`;
  confirmed reachability from `dwc3_core_init()` only on ULPI-capable
  HW.
- [Phase 6] `git branch --contains a28de63356575` shows the commit is in
  `bus-next` (linux-next branch for 7.1), not yet in `master` (7.0),
  matching its status as a backport candidate.
- [Phase 8] Severity HIGH verified via the Microchip erratum title
  "Device Enumeration Failure with Link IP Systems" cited in commit
  message and the Xilinx/AMD forum title "USB stuck in full speed mode
  with USB3340 ULPI PHY".
- UNVERIFIED: Exact port counts affected on ZynqMP deployments – not
  needed for decision.
- UNVERIFIED: Whether the patch has been tested on multiple HW variants
  – only author's testing environment implied.

The patch is a well-bounded hardware quirk for a documented silicon bug
on a real, shipping platform; it fits the stable rules' explicit
quirk/workaround exception, carries essentially zero regression risk to
unaffected systems, and is maintainer-Acked. For stable branches v6.10
and newer it should apply cleanly; older branches would need a small
adjustment to the port-iteration model.

**YES**
