I reckon an early "if (!size) return 0;" in iommu_unmap() would suffice 
to cover the internal error cleanup paths and most careless external 
users. However if we don't trust iommu_unmap_fast() users to always do 
the right thing either then we want this check in iommu_iotlb_sync() 
anyway, at which point the iommu_unmap() check would really only serve 
to skip a bit more unnecessary work on error cleanup paths, and do we 
really care about optimising errors? Hence I'm satisfied that this patch 
does in fact seem to be the best option.

No, that's fine, I just wanted to confirm the intent - this isn't a 
place where we should need to be concerned about micro-optimising to 
maybe save a load and an extra ALU op or two, just that I don't think 
it's worth doing any more than strictly necessary for our own 
robustness. Thus there's no need to change the check in 
iommu_iotlb_gather_is_disjoint() either, as that now just serves to skip 
the redundant reinitialisation of an already-empty gather, which is 
justifiably a different thing from the actual validity-of-sync condition 
anyway.

Cheers,
Robin.
