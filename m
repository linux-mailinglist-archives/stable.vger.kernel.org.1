Yeah, my current analysis didn=E2=80=99t show any storage performance =
issues. I=E2=80=99ll revisit this once more to make sure I=E2=80=99m not =
missing anything. We=E2=80=99ve previously had issues in this area that =
turned out to be kernel bugs. We didn=E2=80=99t change anything =
regarding journal sizes and only a recent kernel upgrade seemed to be =
relevant.

Yeah, we=E2=80=99ve started upgrading selected/affected projects to =
6.12, to see whether this improves things.

We=E2=80=99re running the NixOS mainline versions which are very =
vanilla. There are very very 4 small patches that only fix up things =
around building and binary paths for helpers to call to adapt them to =
the nix environment.
