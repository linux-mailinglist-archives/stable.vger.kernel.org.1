It will be supplemented with

Together they should fairly sustainable framework.

Lino, can you add the same fixes tag as for this. It would probably
ignore inline comments to keep the patch minimal since it is a
critical fix. Just do the renames, remove inline comments and
send v3.

For tpm_tis_check_for_interrupt_storm(), you can could rename it
simply as tpm_tis_update_unhandle_irqs() as that it what it does
(my review did not include a suggestion for this).

This way I think it should be fairly trivial to get a version that
can be landed.

To put short:
1. Do the renames as suggested, they are good enough for me.
2. Drop inline comments, their usefulness is somewhat questionable
   and they increase the diff.
3. Generally aim for minimal diff but I think this should be good
   enough if you do steps 1 and 2.

If you don't have the time at hand, I can carefully do these cleanups
and apply the patch. If you have the time and motivation, go ahead
and send v3.

BR, Jarkko
