I apologize. As I commented on the nvmet-fc patch, I should have
included where the flexible array member was within 'struct mxser_port',
especially since I already knew it from
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/2026.

I hope we can all agree now that this is not a compiler bug or issue.

I think the only part of the warning text that got quoted above should
clarify why this is not a real solution.

For the record, if this was a true issue on the compiler side, I would
have made that very clear in the commit message (or perhaps not even
sent the patch in the first place and worked to get it fixed on the
compiler side, as ClangBuiltLinux has always tried to do first since the
beginning).

> > What does gcc say BTW?

GCC does not have any support for __counted_by merged yet. I suspect
that its current implementation won't say anything either, otherwise
Kees should have noticed it in his testing. As you and Gustavo note
further down thread, sentinel is flagged by
-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end.

  In file included from include/linux/tty_port.h:8,
                   from include/linux/tty.h:11,
                   from drivers/tty/mxser.c:24:
  include/linux/tty_buffer.h:40:27: warning: structure containing a flexible array member is not at the end of another structure [-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end]
     40 |         struct tty_buffer sentinel;
        |                           ^~~~~~~~

Gustavo has a suggested diff to resolve the issue at the GitHub issue I
linked above that seems like a reasonable fix for both issues that is
small enough to go into stable trees that contain f34907ecca71 like this
one?

Cheers,
Nathan
