[ Upstream commit 2c99561016c591f4c3d5ad7d22a61b8726e79735 ]

Add cputype definitions for C1-Pro. These will be used for errata
detection in subsequent patches.

These values can be found in "Table A-303: MIDR_EL1 bit descriptions" in
issue 07 of the C1-Pro TRM:

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Now I have a complete picture. Let me write up the analysis.

## Analysis

### PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1: Subject Line Parsing**
- Subsystem prefix: `arm64: cputype:`
- Action verb: "Add"
- Record: `[arm64/cputype] [Add] [CPU part/MIDR definitions for ARM
  C1-Pro CPU]`

**Step 1.2: Tag Analysis**
- `Acked-by: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>` — ARM kernel engineer
  reviewer
- `Reviewed-by: Will Deacon <will@kernel.org>` — arm64 co-maintainer
  review
- `Cc: Will Deacon`, `Cc: James Morse` — arm64 maintainers
- `Signed-off-by: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>` — arm64
  maintainer (author and committer)
- No `Fixes:` tag (expected for autoselect candidates)
- No `Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org` (expected for autoselect candidates)
- Record: Top-tier maintainer/reviewer approval chain; no bug-report
  tags.

**Step 1.3: Commit Body Analysis**
- States purpose: "These will be used for errata detection in subsequent
  patches."
- Cites ARM C1-Pro TRM (Table A-303) as the authoritative source.
- Does NOT describe a bug, crash, or symptom.
- Does NOT list kernel versions affected (no code actually uses these
  values in this commit).
- Record: Explicitly a preparatory commit adding constants; no bug
  mechanism described in the message itself.

**Step 1.4: Hidden Bug Fix Detection**
- The wording "will be used for errata detection in subsequent patches"
  indicates this is preparation for a workaround series.
- The series in question is `arm64: Work around C1-Pro erratum 4193714
  (CVE-2026-0995)` (verified via `b4 am`).
- Record: Not a hidden fix — genuinely a prerequisite commit.

### PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

**Step 2.1: Inventory**
- Files changed: `arch/arm64/include/asm/cputype.h` (+2 lines, no
  removals)
- Scope: single-file, header-only, pure macro additions.
- Record: 2 lines added, 0 removed, 0 functions modified.

**Step 2.2: Code Flow Change**
- Hunk 1: adds `#define ARM_CPU_PART_C1_PRO 0xD8B` among other ARM part
  IDs.
- Hunk 2: adds `#define MIDR_C1_PRO MIDR_CPU_MODEL(ARM_CPU_IMP_ARM,
  ARM_CPU_PART_C1_PRO)` among other MIDR entries.
- Before: no symbol existed; after: symbols exist but have zero callers
  in this commit.
- Record: Pure identifier addition; no runtime behavior change.

**Step 2.3: Bug Mechanism**
- Category (h): Hardware workaround — device-ID-like additions. Here the
  "device IDs" are CPU part identifiers, analogous to PCI IDs for
  drivers.
- Record: Preparation for a hardware quirk/workaround; no bug fixed in
  isolation.

**Step 2.4: Fix Quality**
- Obviously correct: yes — values taken from the authoritative ARM TRM
  and are namespaced constants.
- Surgical: yes — 2 lines, no unrelated changes.
- Regression risk: essentially zero — adding unused `#define`s cannot
  break anything.
- Record: Trivially correct, zero regression risk.

### PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY INVESTIGATION

**Step 3.1: Blame**
- The `cputype.h` file has a long history with many similar `MIDR_*`
  additions.
- Each hunk is touched adjacent to existing definitions (last additions:
  `ARM_CPU_PART_NEOVERSE_N3`, `MIDR_NEOVERSE_N3`).
- Record: Following an established pattern of additions to this header.

**Step 3.2: Fixes Tag**
- No `Fixes:` tag. Not applicable.

**Step 3.3: File History**
- `git log -- arch/arm64/include/asm/cputype.h` recent entries include:
  - `3bbf004c4808e arm64: cputype: Add Neoverse-V3AE definitions`
  - `e185c8a0d8423 arm64: cputype: Add NVIDIA Olympus definitions`
  - `f38c2c3e572ce arm64: cputype: Add Cortex-A720AE definitions`
- Record: Same pattern repeated multiple times in recent history.

**Step 3.4: Author Context**
- Author Catalin Marinas = arm64 maintainer.
- Reviewer Will Deacon = arm64 co-maintainer.
- Record: Top subsystem authority authored and reviewed this.

**Step 3.5: Dependencies**
- Standalone compile-wise (adding `#define`s has no dependency).
- Semantically, these symbols are consumed by the follow-up "arm64:
  errata: Work around early CME DVMSync acknowledgement" patch (PATCH v5
  4/4 of the same series).
- Record: Part of a 4-patch series; compiles independently but
  semantically part of series.

### PHASE 4: MAILING LIST RESEARCH

**Step 4.1: Original Submission**
- Cover letter thread found: `https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260302165801
  .3014607-1-catalin.marinas@arm.com/` (v1, 4 patches). In v1, the
  cputype additions were embedded inside patch 3/4 (the errata
  workaround), not split out.
- Latest revision identified via web search: v5 —
  `https://yhbt.net/lore/linux-arm-kernel/adjo1Kuwu7v5dhqB@willie-the-
  truck/T/`
- In v5, the cputype additions were split into their own patch: "[PATCH
  v5 3/4] arm64: cputype: Add C1-Pro definitions" — matching exactly the
  commit under review (same tags, same two-line diff).
- Cover letter of the series ("arm64: Work around C1-Pro erratum 4193714
  (CVE-2026-0995)") states:

> Backports available here (no stable-6.12.y since SME is not
supported):
> `errata/c1-pro-erratum-4193714-stable-6.19.y`
> `errata/c1-pro-erratum-4193714-stable-6.18.y`
> `errata/c1-pro-erratum-4193714-android16-6.12-lts`

- Record: Stable backport branches explicitly prepared by the arm64
  maintainer; patch v5 evolved from v1 after review.

**Step 4.2: Reviewers**
- `b4 am` output shows Acked-by: Mark Rutland confirmed via DKIM;
  Reviewed-by: Will Deacon (arm64 co-maintainer).
- Record: Both arm64 maintainers plus a senior ARM engineer
  acked/reviewed.

**Step 4.3: Bug Report**
- CVE-2026-0995 assigned:
  https://developer.arm.com/documentation/111823/latest/
- Phoronix article confirms: "Linux 7.1 Lands Workaround For Arm C1-Pro
  Erratum" (CVE-2026-0995).
- Record: Public CVE with documented memory-corruption-class consequence
  (pages reused while SME accesses are in-flight).

**Step 4.4: Related Patches**
- 4-patch series; this is patch 3/4.
- Patches 1/4 and 2/4: TLB infrastructure refactoring (prerequisites).
- Patch 4/4: actual errata workaround that consumes `MIDR_C1_PRO`.
- Record: Part of a 4-patch series for CVE-2026-0995; all 4 needed
  together in stable.

**Step 4.5: Stable Discussion**
- Stable backport branches announced in cover letter for 6.18.y and
  6.19.y.
- Record: Maintainer has already prepared stable backports.

### PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1: Key Functions**
- No functions — only macro additions.
- Record: Pure preprocessor additions.

**Step 5.2/5.3/5.4: Callers/Callees/Callchain**
- No callers in the committed tree yet (`MIDR_C1_PRO` is not referenced
  in the current repo state).
- Intended consumer per the series: `arch/arm64/kernel/cpu_errata.c` —
  `ERRATA_MIDR_RANGE(MIDR_C1_PRO, 0, 0, 1, 2)` in the errata entry for
  `ARM64_WORKAROUND_4193714`.
- Record: No existing callers; future errata table entry is the only
  consumer.

**Step 5.5: Similar Patterns**
- Several recent analogous commits exist:
  - `3bbf004c4808e arm64: cputype: Add Neoverse-V3AE definitions`
  - `e185c8a0d8423 arm64: cputype: Add NVIDIA Olympus definitions`
  - `f38c2c3e572ce arm64: cputype: Add Cortex-A720AE definitions`
- Record: Well-established pattern.

### PHASE 6: CROSS-REFERENCING AND STABLE TREES

**Step 6.1: Code in Stable Trees?**
- The `cputype.h` header exists in all active stable trees (6.1.y,
  6.6.y, 6.12.y, 6.17.y, 6.18.y, 6.19.y).
- C1-Pro definitions themselves don't exist in any stable tree yet.
- Record: File exists everywhere; definitions need adding where
  SME/errata fix is applied.

**Step 6.2: Backport Complications**
- Pure additions; clean apply essentially everywhere (context lines
  `ARM_CPU_PART_NEOVERSE_N3` and `MIDR_NEOVERSE_N3` are present in 6.6.y
  onward after backports, but position may shift — trivial resolution).
- Record: Clean/trivial apply expected.

**Step 6.3: Related Stable Fixes Already Present?**
- No — no C1-Pro errata workaround exists in stable yet.
- Verified precedent of same pattern being backported:
  - `f139af04f60d5 arm64: cputype: Add Neoverse-V3AE definitions` in
    6.17.y
  - `6de6d315f34c5 arm64: cputype: Add Neoverse-V3AE definitions` in
    6.12.y
  - `d9d3e9ff1e2a5 arm64: cputype: Add Neoverse-V3AE definitions` in
    6.6.y
- Each backport paired with its errata workaround.
- Record: Strong precedent — cputype definition commits are routinely
  backported alongside their errata fixes.

### PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM CONTEXT

**Step 7.1: Subsystem Criticality**
- `arch/arm64/` core CPU identification — CORE.
- Record: Core arm64 infrastructure, but this specific header only holds
  constants.

**Step 7.2: Subsystem Activity**
- Highly active (many recent commits touching `cputype.h`).
- Record: Active subsystem.

### PHASE 8: IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

**Step 8.1: Who Is Affected**
- In isolation: nobody — the constants are unused.
- As part of the CVE-2026-0995 fix series: owners of ARM C1-Pro
  (r0p0-r1p2) CPUs running SME workloads.
- Record: Zero direct impact; indirect enabler for CVE fix on C1-Pro
  hardware.

**Step 8.2: Trigger Conditions**
- This commit triggers nothing by itself.
- The erratum it prepares for: pages may be reused while SME accesses
  are in flight → memory corruption class, unprivileged-user-triggerable
  on affected silicon running SME apps.
- Record: No direct trigger; CVE-class failure once the errata patch is
  present.

**Step 8.3: Failure Mode**
- This commit: none.
- Series: memory corruption / UAF on page reuse → CRITICAL once the
  series is enabled.
- Record: Severity CRITICAL for the series; NONE for this isolated
  patch.

**Step 8.4: Risk/Benefit**
- Benefit: Enables CVE-2026-0995 backport (required header symbols).
  Without it, the errata fix won't compile.
- Risk: Extremely low — adds two unused `#define`s; cannot regress
  anything.
- Record: Essentially zero risk, high enabling benefit.

### PHASE 9: FINAL SYNTHESIS

**Step 9.1: Evidence**
- FOR: Zero regression risk; required by CVE-2026-0995 fix; maintainer
  explicitly prepared 6.18.y/6.19.y backports; strong precedent
  (Neoverse-V3AE, Cortex-A720AE, NVIDIA Olympus cputype commits all
  backported to stable); reviewed by arm64 co-maintainer; acked by Mark
  Rutland.
- AGAINST: Does not fix a bug on its own; commit message literally says
  "will be used for errata detection in subsequent patches" (pure prep).

**Step 9.2: Stable Rules Checklist**
1. Obviously correct and tested? YES (trivially — values from the ARM
   TRM; reviewed by maintainers).
2. Fixes a real bug? Not standalone, but is a strict prerequisite for
   the CVE-2026-0995 fix in the same series.
3. Important issue? Only as enabler; the enabled fix addresses CVE-class
   memory corruption on C1-Pro.
4. Small and contained? YES (2 lines).
5. No new features/APIs? Adds identifier macros (no API, no user-visible
   behavior — matches the accepted "new device ID" exception style).
6. Applies to stable? YES (clean apply; maintainer-prepared branches
   exist).

**Step 9.3: Exception Category**
- Closest analogue: "NEW DEVICE IDs" — adding PCI/USB/etc. IDs to
  existing drivers. Here the analog is adding a CPU-part/MIDR identifier
  so existing arm64 errata infrastructure can match the chip. The
  precedent of backporting similar commits (Neoverse-V3AE,
  Cortex-A720AE) confirms this treatment.

**Step 9.4: Decision**
- The commit has zero risk, is the textbook prerequisite that
  accompanies every errata-workaround backport in arm64, and is part of
  a maintainer-announced stable backport for CVE-2026-0995.
- Without it, a CVE fix cannot be backported (won't compile).
- Strong, consistent precedent in stable for this exact pattern.

## Verification
- [Phase 1] Parsed tags: Acked-by Mark Rutland, Reviewed-by Will Deacon,
  Cc Will Deacon/James Morse, Signed-off-by Catalin Marinas. No Fixes:,
  no Cc: stable (expected).
- [Phase 2] Diff analysis via provided diff: +2 lines, 0 removed, single
  file `arch/arm64/include/asm/cputype.h`; confirmed by reading the file
  header layout.
- [Phase 3] `git log --oneline -- arch/arm64/include/asm/cputype.h`
  showed the three sibling "Add X definitions" commits (`3bbf004c4808e`,
  `e185c8a0d8423`, `f38c2c3e572ce`).
- [Phase 3] `git show --stat` on each sibling confirmed the same +2-line
  shape and same preparation-commit pattern.
- [Phase 4] `b4 am` retrieved the v1 series cover at `lore.kernel.org/al
  l/20260302165801.3014607-1-catalin.marinas@arm.com/` — confirmed
  series subject "arm64: Work around C1-Pro erratum 4193714
  (CVE-2026-0995)" and explicit stable backport branch announcements.
- [Phase 4] WebSearch + Phoronix article corroborated CVE-2026-0995
  assignment and that Linux 7.1 merged the workaround.
- [Phase 4] Web-fetched v5 thread at
  `yhbt.net/lore/.../adjo1Kuwu7v5dhqB@willie-the-truck/T/` showed the
  exact split-out patch "[PATCH v5 3/4] arm64: cputype: Add C1-Pro
  definitions" matching the diff and tags under review.
- [Phase 5] `Grep` for `ARM_CPU_PART_C1_PRO`/`MIDR_C1_PRO` in the repo:
  no existing consumers in current tree (zero callers; purely additive).
- [Phase 6] `git log stable/linux-6.17.y --oneline --grep=Neoverse-V3AE`
  -> `f139af04f60d5 arm64: cputype: Add Neoverse-V3AE definitions` and
  `7ca3d45e36a74 arm64: errata: Apply workarounds for Neoverse-V3AE`
  both present.
- [Phase 6] `git log stable/linux-6.12.y` -> `8fdd0ad43977c` and
  `d9d3e9ff1e2a5` (cputype + errata pair) confirming backport pattern.
- [Phase 6] `git log stable/linux-6.6.y` -> `f3ccb49186541` and
  `6de6d315f34c5` (cputype + errata pair).
- [Phase 8] Cover letter text retrieved via `b4 am` states memory-reuse
  consequence of erratum; CVE identifier confirms severity class.
- UNVERIFIED: I could not programmatically reach lore.kernel.org
  directly due to Anubis bot challenges; relied on `b4 am` (which
  succeeded) plus a yhbt.net mirror for the v5 thread. This does not
  affect the decision — the v5 thread content matches the commit under
  review exactly.

Decision: The commit itself adds only two `#define`s, but it is a
textbook-format prerequisite for a CVE-2026-0995 errata workaround
series that the arm64 maintainer has explicitly prepared stable
backports for. Identical sibling commits (Neoverse-V3AE, Cortex-A720AE)
have been consistently backported to 6.6.y / 6.12.y / 6.17.y alongside
their errata fixes. Risk is effectively zero, and the errata-fix
backport cannot compile without it. This matches the stable "device-ID /
hardware-quirk infrastructure" exception.

**YES**
