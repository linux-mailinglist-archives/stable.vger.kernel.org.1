Lore does not do that (b4 (the tool to download patch series from lore)
usually can link a series to its previous version, though).
New replies sent to a patch submission do end up in the right thread,
so any later comments (bug reports, Reviewed/Tested-by tags, ...)
can be found easily by following the Link: tag in the commit.

Oh, so they were not "truncated to the end of the disk"?
