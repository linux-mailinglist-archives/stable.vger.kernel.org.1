It is not a simple thing to decided if we should make changes or not,
if we don't have the hardware. The test robot is saying things are
potentially wrong, but we don't have any users complaining it is
broken. If we make the test robot happy, without testing the changes,
we can make users unhappy by breaking it. And that is the opposite of
what we want.

We also need to think about "return on investment". Is anybody
actually using this device still? Would it be better to spend our time
on other devices we know are actually used?

If you can find a board which actually has this device, or can find
somebody to run tests, then great, we are likely to accept them. But
otherwise please focus on minimum low risk changes which are obviously
correct, or just leave the test robot unhappy.

	Andrew
