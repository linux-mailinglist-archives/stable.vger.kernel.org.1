[ Upstream commit d1062683bf6b560b31f287eb0ebde4841bc72376 ]

d_make_root() consumes the reference to the passed inode: it either
attaches it to the newly created dentry on success, or drops it via
iput() on failure.

In the error path, the code currently does:
    sb->s_root = d_make_root(inode);
    if (!sb->s_root)
        goto put_inode_out;

which leads to a second iput(inode) in put_inode_out. This results in
a double iput and may trigger a use-after-free if the inode gets freed
after the first iput().

Fix this by jumping directly to the common cleanup path, avoiding the
extra iput(inode).

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Now I have enough information to complete a comprehensive analysis.

# Phase-by-Phase Analysis

## PHASE 1: COMMIT MESSAGE FORENSICS

**Step 1.1 — Subject line parsing**
Record: subsystem = `fs/ntfs3`; action verb = `fix`; summary = "fix
potential double iput on d_make_root() failure".

**Step 1.2 — All commit message tags**
Record:
- No `Fixes:` tag (absence is expected — reason for manual review).
- No `Reported-by:` / `Tested-by:` / `Reviewed-by:` / `Acked-by:`.
- No `Link:`.
- No `Cc: stable`.
- `Signed-off-by:` Zhan Xusheng (author) and Konstantin Komarov (ntfs3
  maintainer who applied it).

**Step 1.3 — Commit body**
Record: Author describes the VFS contract for `d_make_root()` — it
consumes the inode reference on both success and failure (on failure it
calls `iput()` internally). The ntfs3 error path jumps to the
`put_inode_out` label, which calls `iput(inode)` again, giving a double
`iput`. Consequence: "may trigger a use-after-free if the inode gets
freed after the first iput()". Root cause is a misunderstanding of
`d_make_root()` semantics.

**Step 1.4 — Hidden bug fix detection**
Record: Not hidden — explicitly "fix". Author correctly identifies the
VFS-API contract violation.

## PHASE 2: DIFF ANALYSIS

**Step 2.1 — Inventory**
Record: Single file `fs/ntfs3/super.c`, one function
`ntfs_fill_super()`, one line changed (`goto put_inode_out` → `goto
out`). Net diff: 1 insertion, 1 deletion. Scope: surgical single-line
fix.

**Step 2.2 — Code flow change**
Record:
- BEFORE: if `d_make_root()` returns NULL, jump to `put_inode_out:`
  which does `iput(inode);` then falls through to `out:`.
- AFTER: if `d_make_root()` returns NULL, jump directly to `out:`,
  skipping the extra `iput()`.

**Step 2.3 — Bug mechanism**
Record: Category = (d) Memory safety / double-free. Verified
`d_make_root()` semantics against `fs/dcache.c`:

```2042:2054:fs/dcache.c
struct dentry *d_make_root(struct inode *root_inode)
{
        struct dentry *res = NULL;

        if (root_inode) {
                res = d_alloc_anon(root_inode->i_sb);
                if (res)
                        d_instantiate(res, root_inode);
                else
                        iput(root_inode);
        }
        return res;
}
```

When `d_alloc_anon()` fails, `d_make_root()` calls `iput(root_inode)`
and returns NULL. The caller must not call `iput()` again. The ntfs3
code was violating this, producing a double `iput`.

**Step 2.4 — Fix quality**
Record: Obviously correct. Minimal. Zero regression risk: it only
removes an extra `iput()` that is already performed inside
`d_make_root()`. The only behavior change is replacing a guaranteed
double-`iput`/UAF with the correct single release.

## PHASE 3: GIT HISTORY

**Step 3.1 — Blame**
Record: The buggy `goto put_inode_out` on `d_make_root()` failure was
introduced in `9b75450d6c580` ("fs/ntfs3: Fix memory leak if fill_super
failed", 2021-09-28). `git describe --contains 9b75450d6c580` =
`v5.15-rc6~33^2~6`, i.e., the bug has been present since the very first
released kernel that contained ntfs3 (v5.15).

**Step 3.2 — Fixes: tag**
Record: No `Fixes:` tag in the commit, but via `git log -L` I confirmed
the buggy construct was introduced by `9b75450d6c580`. That commit is in
v5.15 and therefore exists in every currently maintained stable tree.

**Step 3.3 — Related changes in file**
Record: `put_inode_out` was specifically reintroduced around the same
timeframe and further exercised by `c1ca8ef0262b2` ("fs/ntfs3: Add null
pointer check for inode operations", 2022). Not part of a series.
Standalone fix.

**Step 3.4 — Author**
Record: Author Zhan Xusheng has several small fixes merged previously
(timers, staging, sched/fair). Not the ntfs3 maintainer, but the
maintainer (Konstantin Komarov) explicitly applied the patch.

**Step 3.5 — Dependencies**
Record: None. Single-line edit inside pre-existing error handling. Self-
contained.

## PHASE 4: MAILING LIST RESEARCH

**Step 4.1 — Original patch discussion**
Record: `b4 dig -c d1062683bf6b5` matched by patch-id to the single v1
submission at `https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260326091232.92760-1-
zhanxusheng@xiaomi.com/`. I downloaded the full thread to
`/tmp/ntfs3_double_iput.mbox` and read it.

Key review comments:
- **Al Viro** (VFS maintainer) responded on 2026-04-04 confirming the
  mechanism and went further: "Matter of fact, the whole `put_inode_out`
  should go; if you *ever* get an inode with NULL ->i_op, it's a bug."
  Al did NOT NAK the patch — he pointed at an additional, deeper problem
  that is outside the scope of this fix.
- **Konstantin Komarov** (ntfs3 maintainer) replied on 2026-04-07:
  "Thanks for the patch. It was applied. I'm going to take a closer look
  at this problem."

**Step 4.2 — Reviewers**
Record: `b4 dig -w` shows recipients: Konstantin Komarov (ntfs3
maintainer), linux-kernel, Zhan Xusheng. Review came from both the
subsystem maintainer and Al Viro (VFS maintainer).

**Step 4.3 — Bug report**
Record: No linked syzbot / bugzilla report — the bug was found by code
inspection of the `d_make_root()` contract.

**Step 4.4 — Related patches**
Record: `b4 dig -a` shows only v1 applied. Standalone, not part of a
multi-patch series.

**Step 4.5 — Stable mailing list**
Record: N/A (web access blocked by Anubis), but not needed — evidence
from the lore thread is conclusive.

## PHASE 5: CODE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS

**Step 5.1 — Key functions**
Record: Only `ntfs_fill_super()` is touched.

**Step 5.2 — Callers**
Record: `ntfs_fill_super()` is the standard
`fs_context_operations::get_tree` implementation, invoked through
`get_tree_bdev()`, ultimately reachable from the `mount(2)` /
`fsopen(2)` / `fsmount(2)` syscalls. Reachable from any privileged user
(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) that can mount NTFS, plus increasingly from unprivileged
contexts on some distro setups (e.g., mount helpers) and automounters
handling removable NTFS media.

**Step 5.3 — Callees**
Record: The affected branch is purely error-path cleanup:
`d_make_root()` → (fails) → `iput(inode)` was being called twice. No
locks held across the double `iput`.

**Step 5.4 — Reachability**
Record: The failure path requires `d_make_root()` → `d_alloc_anon()` to
return NULL, which happens under memory pressure (kmem allocation
failure). Real, not theoretical; any fuzzer that injects allocation
faults (fail_nth/FAULT_INJECTION) at mount time can hit it.

**Step 5.5 — Similar patterns**
Record: A semantically identical fix was already applied to erofs back
in 2019 (`94832d9399217` "staging: erofs: fix potential double iput in
erofs_read_super()"). This confirms the pattern as a recognized,
backport-worthy bug class.

## PHASE 6: STABLE TREE ANALYSIS

**Step 6.1 — Does the buggy code exist in stable?**
Record: Verified via `git show vTAG:fs/ntfs3/super.c` for v5.15, v6.1,
v6.6, v6.12 — the exact `goto put_inode_out;` pattern on `d_make_root()`
failure is present in all of them. ntfs3 did not exist before v5.15, so
no older stable tree is affected.

**Step 6.2 — Backport complications**
Record: The lines around the change are stable across the tags; the fix
is a 1-line modification to an unchanged region of code. Should apply
cleanly to all stable trees ≥5.15 with zero or trivial conflict
resolution.

**Step 6.3 — Related fixes already in stable?**
Record: None found. This is the first fix for this specific bug.

## PHASE 7: SUBSYSTEM CONTEXT

**Step 7.1 — Subsystem**
Record: `fs/ntfs3` = filesystem driver. Criticality = IMPORTANT (widely
used by distros for NTFS support on removable media and dual-boot
systems).

**Step 7.2 — Activity**
Record: Actively maintained (Konstantin Komarov regularly submits
patches, per `git log`).

## PHASE 8: IMPACT/RISK

**Step 8.1 — Affected users**
Record: Users mounting NTFS volumes with the ntfs3 driver under memory
pressure, plus any fault-injection testing of the mount path. Stable
users on 5.15.y / 6.1.y / 6.6.y / 6.12.y all affected.

**Step 8.2 — Trigger conditions**
Record: Requires `d_alloc_anon()` allocation failure during NTFS mount
(memory pressure or fault injection). Rare in typical use but certainly
reachable; also a reliable fuzzer target.

**Step 8.3 — Failure mode severity**
Record: Double `iput()` → `iput_final()` → `evict()` on an already-freed
inode → use-after-free / kernel crash / potential exploitation. Severity
= HIGH (memory safety bug in privileged mount path).

**Step 8.4 — Risk vs benefit**
Record: BENEFIT = eliminate a real UAF on a clean reachable error path;
also removes the only reviewer-identified memory-safety issue from that
code. RISK = essentially zero: a single label change that removes an
extra `iput()`, which is strictly correct per the VFS API contract.
Endorsed implicitly by Al Viro. Excellent ratio.

## PHASE 9: SYNTHESIS

**Step 9.1 — Evidence**
- FOR: real double-iput / UAF bug, present since v5.15 in all stable
  trees, one-line surgical fix, correct per VFS contract (verified in
  `fs/dcache.c`), applied by subsystem maintainer, acknowledged by VFS
  maintainer Al Viro, same pattern previously backported for erofs,
  reachable from the `mount(2)` syscall, no dependencies.
- AGAINST: No `Fixes:` tag (expected for review); no `Cc: stable` tag
  (expected for review); trigger is allocation failure in
  `d_alloc_anon()` (rare but real). None of these are technical reasons
  to reject.

**Step 9.2 — Stable rules**
1. Obviously correct and tested: YES (trivially correct, applied
   upstream, VFS-contract-conformant).
2. Fixes a real bug: YES (double `iput` → UAF).
3. Important issue: YES (memory safety).
4. Small and contained: YES (1 line).
5. No new features/APIs: YES.
6. Applies to stable trees: YES (verified the surrounding code is
   identical in 5.15/6.1/6.6/6.12).

**Step 9.3 — Exception category**
Not needed — this is a standard bug fix under criterion #3 (serious
crash / memory safety).

**Step 9.4 — Decision**
All evidence supports backporting.

---

## Verification

- [Phase 1] Read commit message; no tags present other than two `Signed-
  off-by:`. Verified no `Fixes:` / `Cc: stable` / `Reported-by:` tags.
- [Phase 2] Inspected the diff — 1 insertion, 1 deletion, one label
  change in error path.
- [Phase 2] Verified `d_make_root()` consumes the inode reference on
  failure by reading `fs/dcache.c:2042-2054` — it calls
  `iput(root_inode)` when `d_alloc_anon()` returns NULL.
- [Phase 2] Read `fs/ntfs3/super.c:1670-1717` to confirm the actual
  `put_inode_out:` label does `iput(inode);` unconditionally, proving
  the double-iput.
- [Phase 3] `git log --oneline -S "put_inode_out" -- fs/ntfs3/super.c`
  and `git log -L` on the changed code block identified `9b75450d6c580`
  as the commit that introduced the buggy `goto put_inode_out`.
- [Phase 3] `git describe --contains 9b75450d6c580` = `v5.15-rc6~33^2~6`
  → bug lives in all stable trees from v5.15 onward.
- [Phase 3] `git describe --contains 82cae269cfa95` =
  `v5.15-rc1~94^2~34` — confirms ntfs3 first appeared in v5.15 (no
  earlier stable affected).
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -c d1062683bf6b5` found single v1 submission at lore
  URL `.../20260326091232.92760-1-zhanxusheng@xiaomi.com/`.
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -c d1062683bf6b5 -a` confirmed only one series
  revision (v1).
- [Phase 4] `b4 dig -c d1062683bf6b5 -w` confirmed original recipients
  include maintainer Konstantin Komarov.
- [Phase 4] Read the downloaded mbox `/tmp/ntfs3_double_iput.mbox`:
  found Al Viro (VFS maintainer) acknowledging the bug mechanism and
  Konstantin Komarov confirming "It was applied".
- [Phase 5] Confirmed identical pattern was fixed for erofs in
  `94832d9399217` — pre-existing backport precedent.
- [Phase 6] Verified the buggy `goto put_inode_out;` on `d_make_root()`
  failure is literally present at v5.15, v6.1, v6.6, v6.12 by `git show
  vTAG:fs/ntfs3/super.c` on each tag.
- [Phase 6] Confirmed fix applies cleanly — only a label change on an
  unchanged surrounding block.
- [Phase 8] Failure mode verified: `iput()` twice on the same inode
  after the first may have dropped the last reference → UAF. Severity
  HIGH.
- UNVERIFIED: The exact frequency of `d_alloc_anon()` returning NULL in
  the wild — not relevant to stable decision because fault-injection and
  OOM paths can both trigger it.

---

## Decision rationale

This is a textbook stable candidate:
- 1-line, provably correct fix based directly on a well-known VFS API
  contract.
- Addresses a double-`iput`/UAF memory safety bug reachable from the
  `mount(2)` syscall.
- Bug present in every currently maintained stable tree (5.15.y, 6.1.y,
  6.6.y, 6.12.y and newer).
- Validated by the ntfs3 maintainer (applied it) and confirmed by VFS
  maintainer Al Viro.
- Identical pattern was previously treated as stable material in other
  filesystems.
- Zero regression risk — it removes an extra `iput` that is already
  performed by `d_make_root()`.
