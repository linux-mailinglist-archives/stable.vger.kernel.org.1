In particular, we can see the same implementation in the recent ACK release https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/tags/android13-5.15-2024-11_r2/drivers/iommu/iommu.c  given on https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/gki-android13-5_15-release-builds

If you wish for a commit to be backported to the stable kernels, just
ask us, and better yet, provide a working patch to do so.

The reason we did NOT backport this specific commit is that it is marked
as a fix for a commit that shows up in the 6.1 release, so why would it
be applicable to 5.15.y at all?  So why do you feel it is required in
5.15.y?  (Note, we have no idea why it's in an Android kernel tree,
perhaps they have the offending commit in there as well so the backport
is required?  Have you checked?)

If you need or want it applied to older kernels, please send us a
working patch and we will be glad to take it.

thanks,

greg k-h
