It's a bit hard to grep for, but I gave it a quick shot too and I can't find any
results for "../" in combination with "fw", "path", "bin", etc. either.

I agree it would be weird. Especially, since there is "firmware_class.path"
available to avoid such hacks.

I think that's reasonable, though it would also be nice to have it in the
documentation of the corresponding functions that take the argument.

Since all the request_firmware() derivates refer to request_firmware(), it's
probably enough to add it there.
