Subject: mm, memcg: reconsider kmem.limit_in_bytes deprecation
Date: Thu, 21 Sep 2023 09:38:29 +0200

This reverts commits 86327e8eb94c ("memcg: drop kmem.limit_in_bytes") and
partially reverts 58056f77502f ("memcg, kmem: further deprecate
kmem.limit_in_bytes") which have incrementally removed support for the
kernel memory accounting hard limit.  Unfortunately it has turned out that
there is still userspace depending on the existence of
memory.kmem.limit_in_bytes [1].  The underlying functionality is not
really required but the non-existent file just confuses the userspace
which fails in the result.  The patch to fix this on the userspace side
has been submitted but it is hard to predict how it will propagate through
the maze of 3rd party consumers of the software.

Now, reverting alone 86327e8eb94c is not an option because there is
another set of userspace which cannot cope with ENOTSUPP returned when
writing to the file.  Therefore we have to go and revisit 58056f77502f as
well.  There are two ways to go ahead.  Either we give up on the
deprecation and fully revert 58056f77502f as well or we can keep
kmem.limit_in_bytes but make the write a noop and warn about the fact. 
This should work for both known breaking workloads which depend on the
existence but do not depend on the hard limit enforcement.

Note to backporters to stable trees.  a8c49af3be5f ("memcg: add per-memcg
total kernel memory stat") introduced in 4.18 has added memcg_account_kmem
so the accounting is not done by obj_cgroup_charge_pages directly for v1
anymore.  Prior kernels need to add it explicitly (thanks to Johannes for
pointing this out).
