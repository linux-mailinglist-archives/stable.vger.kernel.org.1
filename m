Hi Mario,

Thank you for taking a look at my patch.

What do you think about the following for the commit message in the next
revision of the PATCH, and omitting the cover letter since most of it is
incorporated here?

***********************************************************************

cpufreq: amd-pstate: Enable CPU boost in passive and guided modes

The CPU frequency cannot be boosted when using the amd_pstate driver in
passive or guided mode. This is fixed here.

For example, on a host that has AMD EPYC 7662 64-Core processor without
this patch running at full CPU load:

$ for i in $(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq); =
\
  do ni=3D$(echo "scale=3D1; $i/1000000" | bc -l); echo "$ni GHz"; done |=
 \
  sort | uniq -c

    128 2.0 GHz

And with this patch:

$ for i in $(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq); =
\
  do ni=3D$(echo "scale=3D1; $i/1000000" | bc -l); echo "$ni GHz"; done |=
 \
  sort | uniq -c

    128 3.3 GHz

The CPU frequency is dependent on a setting called highest_perf which is
the multiplier used to compute it. The highest_perf value comes from
cppc_init_perf when the driver is built-in and from pstate_init_perf when
it is a loaded module. Both of these calls have the following condition:

        highest_perf =3D amd_get_highest_perf();
        if (highest_perf > __cppc_highest_perf_)
                highest_perf =3D __cppc_highest_perf;

Where again __cppc_highest_perf is either the return from
cppc_get_perf_caps in the built-in case or AMD_CPPC_HIGHEST_PERF in the
module case. Both of these functions actually return the nominal value,
Whereas the call to amd_get_highest_perf returns the correct boost
value, so the condition tests true and highest_perf always ends up being
the nominal value, therefore never having the ability to boost CPU
frequency.

Since amd_get_highest_perf already returns the boost value we should
just eliminate this check.

The issue was introduced in v6.1 via commit bedadcfb011f ("cpufreq:
amd-pstate: Fix initial highest_perf value"), and exists in stable kernel=
s

In v6.6.51, a large change, commit 1ec40a175a48 ("cpufreq: amd-pstate:
Enable amd-pstate preferred core support"), was introduced which
significantly refactored the code. This commit cannot be ported back on
its own, and would require reviewing and cherry picking at least a few
dozen of commits in cpufreq, amd-pstate, ACPI, CPPC.

This means kernels v6.1 up until v6.6.51 are affected by this
significant performance issue, and cannot be easily remediated. This
patch simplifies the fix to a single commit.
