First a comment on this IRQ logging:

These lines do NOT refer to the INTx IRQ(s) but the controller internal
"events" (errors etc). Please see this log for INTx on my Versal
platform with pci_irqd_intx_xlate added:

  24:          0          0  pl_dma:RC-Event   0 Level     LINK_DOWN

  35:          0          0  pl_dma:RC-Event  25 Level     SLV_ILLBUR
  36:          0          0  pl_dma:RC-Event  26 Level     MST_DECERR

  38:         94          0  pl_dma:RC-Event  16 Level     84000000.axi-pcie
  39:         94          0  pl_dma:INTx   0 Level     nvme0q0, nvme0q1

The last line shows the INTx IRQs here ('pl_dma:INTx' vs 'pl_dma:RC-
Event').

Yes. I applied Ravi's patch first and still got no INTx delivered
to the nvme driver. That's what me triggered to dig deeper here and
resulted in this v2 patch with pci_irqd_intx_xlate added.

BTW:
I re-tested just now w/o Ravi's patch and the INTx worked. Still I think
Ravi's patch is valid and should be applied...

Yes, please either apply both separately or squash them. Whatever you
prefer.

Many thanks,
