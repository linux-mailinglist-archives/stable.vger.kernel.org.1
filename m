A problem with this approach is that ASPM will never be enabled (and
power consumption will be higher) in case an endpoint driver is missing.

I think that's something we should try to avoid.

Note that the patch fails to apply to 6.16-rc6 due to changes in
linux-next. Depending on how fast we can come up with a fix it may be
better to target 6.16.

I think you should consider leaving this helper in place here to keep
the size of the diff down (e.g. as you intend to backport this).

You need to use the non-locked helpers here since you no longer hold the
bus semaphore (e.g. as reported by lockdep).

Maybe this makes the previous comment about not moving the helper moot.

This results in an unused variable warning (presumably until the next
patch in the series is applied).

Missing newline.
