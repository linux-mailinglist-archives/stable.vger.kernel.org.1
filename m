Thanks for that explanation, Kent.

I am the one with that external Transcend XS 2000 4 TB SSD and I
specifically did not CC bcachefs mailing list at the beginning as after
seeing things like

[33963.462694] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] tag#10 uas_zap_pending 0 uas-tag 1 infligh=
t: CMD=20
[33963.462708] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] tag#10 CDB: Write(16) 8a 00 00 00 00 00 82=
 c1 bc 00 00 00 04 00 00 00
[=E2=80=A6]
[33963.592872] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] tag#10 FAILED Result: hostbyte=3DDID_RESET=
 driverbyte=3DDRIVER_OK cmd_age=3D182s

I thought some quirks in the device to be at fault.

However while Sandisk Extreme Pro 2 TB claims to support DPO and FUA I see

Write cache: disabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA

also with other devices like external Toshiba Canvio 4 TB hard disks. Using
LUKS encrypted BTRFS on those I never saw any timeout while writing out
data issue with any of those hard disks. Also with disabled write cache
any cache flush / FUA request should be a no-op anyway? These hard disks
have been doing a ton of backup workloads without any issues, but so far
only with BTRFS.

I may test the Transcend XS2000 with BTRFS to see whether it makes a
difference, however I really like to use it with BCacheFS and I do not real=
ly
like to use LUKS for external devices. According to the kernel log I still
don't really think those errors at the block layer were about anything
filesystem specific, but what  do I know?

With UAS enabled for Transcend XS2000 I see:

Write cache: disabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA

This sounds about right: Without cache flush / FUA request disable write
cache.

With UAS disabled, using only usb-storage, however I see:

Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA

Which appears to be broken to me: If it cannot do cache flush / FUA it
should have write cache disabled.

Thus I removed the quirk to disable UAS again. It did not help anyway.

However when I look at the output of "hdparm -I" for that Transcend XS2000
none of this makes sense. Cause it blatantly advertises to support

[=E2=80=A6]
           *    Mandatory FLUSH_CACHE
           *    FLUSH_CACHE_EXT
[=E2=80=A6]
           *    WRITE_{DMA|MULTIPLE}_FUA_EXT
[=E2=80=A6]

It has firmware revision S9K00107. I see whether I can get this updated
in case any update is available. Which is not obvious to me as Kingston
only offers to download a Windows application to update the firmware.

I asked them how to do an update on Linux. But am also prepared to run to
a friend with Windows system to do the update.

There is no urgency in this, so let's see whether a firmware update may
fix anything. In case someone has any additional insight, feel free to add
it. Otherwise I consider it case closed unless I retest with either Linux
kernel 6.7.5 or 6.8-rc4 and/or after having made a firmware update
if available.

Maybe also some other quirks would need to be enabled for that
device? I tested it with:

% cat /etc/modprobe.d/disable-uas.conf
# Does not work with external SSD Transcend XS2000 4TB
options usb-storage quirks=3D0951:176b:u

but as explained that did not help and thus I disabled UAS disabling
quirk again.

Best,
=2D-=20
