Right but in the case of 5.15 (similar for the others) we have:
v5.15.196 5666bcc3c00f Revert "cpuidle: menu: Avoid discarding useful information"
v5.15.185 14790abc8779 cpuidle: menu: Avoid discarding useful information
So your regression on v5.15.196 only restores performance back to pre-v5.15.185
levels, you now don't get an improvement which wasn't originally part of v5.15.
