[ Upstream commit 92fd39634541eb0a11bf1bafbc8ba92d6ddb8dba ]

Currently, whenever fw issues a change ownership event, the PF that owns
the fw tracer drops its ownership directly and the other PFs try to pick
up the ownership via what MTRC register suggests.

In some cases, driver releases the ownership of the tracer and reacquires
it later on. Whenever the driver releases ownership of the tracer, fw
issues a change ownership event. This event can be delayed and come after
driver has reacquired ownership of the tracer. Thus the late event will
trigger the tracer owner PF to release the ownership again and lead to a
scenario where no PF is owning the tracer.

To prevent the scenario described above, when handling a change
ownership event, do not drop ownership of the tracer directly, instead
read the fw MTRC register to retrieve the up-to-date owner of the tracer
and set it accordingly in driver level.
