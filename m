I'm aware of this limiation. But I don't think we should really worry about that
scenario. No one is going to run an OS intentionally with a PCI device and
without the relevant driver. If that happens, it might be due to some issue in
driver loading or the user is doing it intentionally. Such scenarios are short
lived IMO.

I would've fancied a bus notifier post device addition, but there is none
available and I don't see a real incentive in adding one. The other option
would be to add an ops to 'struct pci_host_bridge', but I really try not to
introduce such thing unless really manadatory.

I rebased this series on top of pci/controller/qcom branch, where we have some
dependency. But I could spin an independent fix if Bjorn is OK to take it for
the 6.16-rcS.

Good catch!
