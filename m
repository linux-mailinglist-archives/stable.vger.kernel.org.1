Good question, I already asked it myself.  I'm unaware of any kind of
GPU-OPP-related restrictions when it comes to the PinePhone-Pro-specific
RK3399S.  Furthermore, "the word on the street" is that the RK3399S can
work perfectly fine even at the couple of "full-fat" RK3399 CPU OPPs
that are not defined for the RK3399S, and the only result would be the
expected higher power consumption and a bit more heat generated.

This just reaffirms that no known GPU OPP restrictions exist.  Even
if they existed, enforcing them _primarily_ through the constraints of
the associated voltage regulator would be the wrong approach.  Instead,
the restrictions should be defined primarily through the per-SoC-variant
GPU OPPs, which are, to my best knowledge, not known to be existing for
the RK3399S SoC variant.

> Did you run this on actual hardware?

I rushed a bit to submit the patch before being able to test in on the
actual hardware, but there's already one person willing to test the 
patch
on their PinePhone Pro and provide their Tested-By.  I see no reasons 
why
it shouldn't work as expected, as explained above, which is why I 
decided
it's safe to submit the patch before detailed testing.

I'm very careful when it comes to changes like this one, but I'm quite
confident there should be no issues, just a nice performance boost. :)
I also checked and compared the schematics of the PinePhone Pro and
a couple of other Pine64 RK3399-based boards and devices, to make sure
there are no differences in the GPU regulators that would make the
PinePhone Pro an exception.  I saw no such differences.
