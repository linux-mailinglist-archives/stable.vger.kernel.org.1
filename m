If there is no bq27000 battery, hdq reads 8 bits of 0xff (no client on =
the
1 bit serial bus with pull-up) as the "value" of the battery status =
register.
If there is a battery connected, the value is defined and not 0xff.

See 3dd843e1c26a023dc8d776e5d984c635c642785f

In these cases the bq27xxx driver does not need to be present and does
not interfere.

BTW: the bq27000 is unconditionally added to the hdq subsystem as soon =
as
CONFIG_BATTERY_BQ27XXX_HDQ is configured. On every system. So the =
alternative
to disabling hdq on the processor and enabling in the board specific DTB =
is
to unconfigure CONFIG_BATTERY_BQ27XXX_HDQ if hdq is used for something =
else.

Does the entry disappear if you remove the battery while powered from AC =
and
come back on re-insertion of the battery?

Do they use hdq at all? With i2c it is easier to detect a "no response" =
during
probe or operation. But still i2c assumes that a chip responds at boot
or never (or user-space must run a timer to reprobe every now and then).

IMHO they are not prepared to handle the use case we have for the =
bq27000
and should therefore not be the role model.

I have looked into the ds2780 code but do not understand how they handle =
the case
that the battery is removed or swapped or inserted during operation =
(while on external
power supply).

The max1721x is different. At least from looking into code it behaves =
exactly the same
as the bq27000. There is a POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_PRESENT. Which can always =
be read. It does
this by reading the MAX172XX_REG_STATUS and detecting that some bit =
(MAX172XX_BAT_PRESENT)
is not set. This can either mean no battery connected to the chip or the =
chip (built into
the battery case) is not connected to the hdq bus.

I can not test but would therefore assume the same for the max1721. As =
soon as you configure
it for a hdq capable device/kernel there should be a /sys entry for it =
with present =3D=3D 0.

BTW: all bq27xxx gauges have this property, not only the bq27000.

> If I enable the
> drivers there is no additional battery in /sys/class/power_supply!

Which is surprising because then the max1721x can never report "no =
battery present".
Unless it is always sitting on the main board and the battery is =
connected or not.

Or there is some special logic in the max1721x probe which can detect =
during boot that
the chip is really connected. But then you can not remove a battery with =
built-in
max1721x because it must be installed on first boot and can not be =
inserted later.

What do you mean with "catched earlier"? What is your proposal?

Well, as proposed by Jerry earlier, it appears as if it can also be =
handled in bq27xxx_battery_hdq_read()
by detecting the register BQ27XXX_REG_FLAGS and the read value 0xff and =
return -ENODEV.

Then it would be constrained to the bq27000 - but still not solve your =
issue that boards
may not have a bq27000 option on their hdq bus...

Anyways this discussion now goes far beyond fixing the regression =
introduced by

f16d9fb6cf03 ("power: supply: bq27xxx: Retrieve again when busy")

So I'd suggest to fix the regression first and then add new functions or =
changes (for handling
removable chips and removable batteries reasonably) in a separate patch =
or series. Having separate
patches improves bisectability and is easier to track what has been =
changed (for different reasons).

BR,
Nikolaus
