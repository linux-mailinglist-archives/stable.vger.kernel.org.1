Yes. More recently on the RISC-V platform:

We do have the same issue with pci_proc_attach_device() as well. I submitted a
dumb series [1] that removed both pci_create_sysfs_dev_files() and
pci_proc_attach_device() calls from their _init() calls, but I was pointed out
that they are required for PCI_ROM_RESOURCE.

Then it was suggested that making the sysfs resource files static would be
the proper solution (not sure what's about proc). Krzysztof had some work on
this topic earlier and had plans to revive it, but I guess he didn't get much
time so far.

Krzysztof, if you do not mind, could you please share your previous work so that
someone else can try to extend it if you are busy?
