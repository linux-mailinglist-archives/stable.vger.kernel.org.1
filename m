Subject: [PATCH v2] mm,madvise,hugetlb: check for 0-length range after end address adjustment
Date: Mon,  3 Feb 2025 08:52:06 +0100

Add a sanity check to madvise_dontneed_free() to address a corner case
in madvise where a race condition causes the current vma being processed
to be backed by a different page size.

During a madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) call on a memory region registered with
a userfaultfd, there's a period of time where the process mm lock is
temporarily released in order to send a UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE and let
userspace handle the event. During this time, the vma covering the
current address range may change due to an explicit mmap done
concurrently by another thread.

If, after that change, the memory region, which was originally backed by
4KB pages, is now backed by hugepages, the end address is rounded down
to a hugepage boundary to avoid data loss (see "Fixes" below). This
rounding may cause the end address to be truncated to the same address
as the start.

Make this corner case follow the same semantics as in other similar
cases where the requested region has zero length (ie. return 0).

This will make madvise_walk_vmas() continue to the next vma in the
range (this time holding the process mm lock) which, due to the prev
pointer becoming stale because of the vma change, will be the same
hugepage-backed vma that was just checked before. The next time
madvise_dontneed_free() runs for this vma, if the start address isn't
aligned to a hugepage boundary, it'll return -EINVAL, which is also in
line with the madvise api.

From userspace perspective, madvise() will return EINVAL because the
start address isn't aligned according to the new vma alignment
requirements (hugepage), even though it was correctly page-aligned when
the call was issued.
