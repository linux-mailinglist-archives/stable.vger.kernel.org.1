I did some analysis based on your trace files.
I have been playing some time ago with speedometer performance
issues so that's why I'm curious about your report here.

I've filtered your trace purely based on cpu7 (the single biggest cpu).
Then I have cut the data from the 'warm-up' phase in both traces, to
have similar start point (I think).

It looks like the 2 traces can show similar 'pattern' of that benchmark
which is good for analysis. If you align the timestamp:
176.051s and 972.465s then both plots (frequency changes in time) look
similar.

There are some differences, though:
1. there are more deeps in the freq in time, so more often you would
    pay extra penalty for the ramp-up again
2. some of the ramp-up phases are a bit longer ~100ms instead of ~80ms
    going from 2GHz to 3.6GHz
3.


There are idle phases missing in the trace, so we have to be careful
when e.g. comparing avg frequency, because that might not be the real
indication of the delivered computation and not indicate the gap in the 
score.

Here are the stats:
1. revert:
frequency
count  1.318000e+03
mean   2.932240e+06
std    5.434045e+05
min    2.000000e+06
50%    3.000000e+06
85%    3.600000e+06
90%    3.626000e+06
95%    3.626000e+06
99%    3.626000e+06
max    3.626000e+06

2. base:
           frequency
count  1.551000e+03
mean   2.809391e+06
std    5.369750e+05
min    2.000000e+06
50%    2.800000e+06
85%    3.500000e+06
90%    3.600000e+06
95%    3.626000e+06
99%    3.626000e+06
max    3.626000e+06


A better indication in this case would be comparison of the frequency
residency in time, especially for the max freq:
1. revert: 11.92s
2. base: 9.11s

So there is 2.8s longer residency for that fmax (while we even have
longer period for finishing that Speedometer 2 test on 'base').

Here is some detail about that run*:
+---------------+---------------------+---------------+----------------+
| Trace         | Total Trace         | Time at Max   | % of Total     |
|               | Duration (s)        | Freq (s)      | Time           |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------+----------------+
| Base Trace    | 24.72               | 9.11          | 36.9%          |
| Revert Trace  | 22.88               | 11.92         | 52.1%          |
+---------------+---------------------+---------------+----------------+

*We don't know the idle periods which might happen for those frequencies


I wonder if you had a fix patch for the util_est in your kernel...
That fix has been recently backported to 6.6 stable [1].

You might want to try that patch as well, w/ or w/o this revert.
IMHO it might be worth to have it on top. It might help
the main Chrome task ('CrRendererMain') to stay longer on the biggest
cpu, since the util_est would be higher. You can read the discussion
that I had back then with PeterZ and VincentG [2].

Lukasz
