This series was intented to fix the ASPM issue which exist even before the
introduction of pwrctrl framework. But I also agree that the below commits made
the issue more visible and caused regression on platforms where WLAN used to
work.

We discussed about the ASPM issue IIRC. The above mentioned of_irq_parse_pci
could also be related to the fact that we are turning off the supplies after
pci_dev destruction. For this issue, I guess the patch from Brian could be the
fix:

FYI, I'm going to drop this series in favor this (with one yet-to-be-submitted
patch on top):
