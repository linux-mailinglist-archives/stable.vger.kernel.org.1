Yeah, the part about the "kernel assigning a different offset" is a
bit misleading because the kernel doesn't actually assign or *change*
that offset; it only *discovers* the offset, typically from an ACPI
_TRA method or from device tree.

Works now, thanks!

Yeah, I don't know either.  screen_info_resources() takes a struct
resource pointer, but puts bus addresses into it.  That's misleading
at best, but it would be quite a bit more work to fix that.

I'm not sure we have a generic struct for bus addresses.  We have
struct pci_bus_region, but I'm not sure if screen_info is necessarily
specific to PCI.
