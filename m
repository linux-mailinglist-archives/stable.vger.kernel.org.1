I got some reply back from Transcend support.

They brought up two possible issues:

1) Copied to many files at once. I am not going to accept that one. An=20
external 4 TB SSD should handle writing 1,4 TB in about 215000 files,=20
coming from a slower Toshiba Canvio Basics external HD, just fine. About=20
90000 files was larger files like sound and video files or installation=20
archives. The rest is from a Linux system backup, so smaller files. I=20
likely move those elsewhere before I try again as I do not need these on=20
flash anyway. However if the amount of files or data matters I could never=
=20
know what amount of data I could write safely in one go. That is not=20
acceptable to me.

2) Power management related to USB port. Cause I am using a laptop. It may=
=20
have been that the Linux kernel decided to put the USB port the SSD was=20
connected to into some kind of sleep state. However it was a constant=20
rsync based copy workload. Yes, the kernel buffers data and the reads from=
=20
Toshiba HD should be quite a bit slower than the Transcend SSD could=20
handle the writes. I saw now more than 80-90 MiB/s coming from the hard=20
disk. However I would doubt this lead to pauses of write activity of more=20
than 30 seconds. Still it could be a thing.

Regarding further testing I am unsure whether to first test with BTRFS on=20
top of LUKS =E2=80=93 I do not like to store clear text data on the SSD =E2=
=80=93 or with=20
BCacheFS plus fixes which are 6.7.5 or 6.8-rc4 in just in the case the flus=
h=20
handling fixes would still have an influence on the issue at hand.

=46irst I will have a look on how to see what USB power management options=
=20
may be in place and how to tell Linux to keep the USB port the SSD is=20
connected to at all times.

Let's see how this story unfolds. At least I am in no hurry about it.

Best,
=2D-=20
Martin
