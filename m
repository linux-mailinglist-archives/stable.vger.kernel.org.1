Heh, I never really tried to figure out it because the reset disable=20
patch was just a stab into the dark style patch. To my surprise, it ended=
=20
up working (after the initial confusion was resolved) and I just started=20
to prepare this patch from that knowledge.

Logs do mention this:

[   21.560206] pcieport 0000:00:01.1: unlocked secondary bus reset via: pci=
ehp_reset_slot+0x98/0x140

=2E..so it seems to be SBR.

Looking into lspci logs, I don't see DPC capability being there for=20

They do occur also when BW controller is disabled for the duration of=20
reset. What I don't currently have at hand is a comparable log from era=20
prior to any BW controller commits (from 6.12). The one currently in=20
bugzilla has the out-of-tree module loaded.

PME and BW notifications do share the interrupt so I'd not entirely=20
discount their relevance though, and one of my theories (never mentioned=20
anywhere until now) was that the extra interrupts that come due to BW=20
notifications somehow manage to confuse PME driver. But I never found=20
anything to that effect.

I can remove the PME lines though.

Will it work? I mean if the port itself is not reset (0000:00:01.1 in this=
=20
case), do these callbacks get called for it?

If enabling on restore of the first dev, BW notifications would get=20
enabled before the last of the devices has been restored. While it might=20
work, the test patch, after all, did work without this complexity, IMO it=
=20
seems unwise to create such a racy pattern.

For disable side, I think it would be possible to always disable=20
unconditionally.
