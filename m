This immediately threw me off.
The fixup was written for a specific system which had completely broken
cpuidle. It shouldn't affect any sane system significantly.
I double checked the numbers and your system looks fine, in fact none of
the tests had any rejected cpuidle occurrences. So functionally base and
base-fixup are identical for you. The cpuidle numbers are also reasonably
'in the noise', so just for the future some stats would be helpful on those
scores.

I can see a huge difference between base and revert in terms of cpuidle,
so that's enough for me to take a look, I'll do that now.
(6.1-revert has more C3_ACPI in favor of C1_ACPI.)

(Also I can't send this email without at least recommending teo instead of menu
for your platform / use-cases, if you deemed it unfit I'd love to know what
didn't work for you!)
