Seriously?!

Metadir has been out for review in some form or another since January
2019[1].  If five years and eleven months is not sufficient for you to
review a patchset or even to make enough noise that I'm aware that
you're even reading my code, then I don't want you ever to touch any of
my patchsets ever again.

Go work on the maintenance mode filesystems like JFS then.  Shaggy would
probably love it if someone took on some of that.

What are you doing downstream these days, exactly?  You don't
participate in the LTS process at all, and your employer boasts about
ignoring that community process.  If your employer chooses to perform
independent forklift upgrades of the XFS codebase in its product every
three months and you don't like that, take it up with them, not
upstream.
