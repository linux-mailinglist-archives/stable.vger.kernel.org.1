Just to make it clear: the patch is correct, the shortcoming is in the des=
cription=2E=20

I would say that Xin's description, although perhaps excessively brief, is=
 correct from the *hardware* point of view, whereas Rafael adds the much ne=
eded *software* perspective=2E=20

As far as hardware is concerned, Linux S4 is just a power on (we don't use=
 any BIOS support for S4 even if it exists, which it rarely does anymore, a=
nd for very good reasons=2E) From a software point of view, it is more like=
 a kexec into the frozen kernel image, which then has to re-establish its r=
untime execution environment =E2=80=93 (including the FRED state, which is =
what this patch does=2E)

For the APs this is done through the normal AP bringup mechanism, it is on=
ly the BSP that needs special treatment=2E
