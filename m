Would something like this be what you're imagining? If so I can post a
patch if this patch is a dead end:

    diff --git a/drivers/pci/of.c b/drivers/pci/of.c

                                    rc = -EINVAL;

I must admit that you being nervous has me being nervous since I'm not all
that familiar with PCI... but if y'all think this is ok then I'm for it.
I'm sure I'm not picturing all the cases here so would appreciate
some scrutiny.

You still end up with warnings, which kind of sucks, since as I
understand it the lack of INTx interrupts on this platform is
*intentional*:

    [    3.342548] pci_bus 0000:00: 2-byte config write to 0000:00:00.0 offset 0x4 may corrupt adjacent RW1C bits
    [    3.346716] pcieport 0000:00:00.0: of_irq_parse_pci: no interrupt-map found, INTx interrupts not available
    [    3.346721] PCI: OF: of_irq_parse_pci: possibly some PCI slots don't have level triggered interrupts capability

You could have a combo of both this patch (to indicate that a specific driver (even further
limited to a match data based on compatible) doesn't support these) as well as
the above diff (to improve the message printed in the situation where a driver
*does* claim to support these interrupts but fails to describe them properly).

Am I barking up the right tree? If so I'll submit a proper patch
independent of this (and depending on your views we can continue with v2
of this patch too, or not).

Thanks,
Andrew
