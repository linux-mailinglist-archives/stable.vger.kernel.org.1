Patch series "mm/hugetlb: Refactor hugetlb allocation resv accounting",
v2.

This is a follow up on Ackerley's series here as replacement:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/cover.1728684491.git.ackerleytng@google.com

The goal of this series is to cleanup hugetlb resv accounting, especially
during folio allocation, to decouple a few things:

  - Hugetlb folios v.s. Hugetlbfs: IOW, the hope is in the future hugetlb
    folios can be allocated completely without hugetlbfs.

  - Decouple VMA v.s. hugetlb folio allocations: allocating a hugetlb folio
    should not always require a hugetlbfs VMA.  For example, either it got
    allocated from the inode level (see hugetlbfs_fallocate() where it used
    a pesudo VMA for allocation), or it can be allocated by other kernel
    subsystems.

It paves way for other users to allocate hugetlb folios out of either
system reservations, or subpools (instead of hugetlbfs, as a file system).
For longer term, this prepares hugetlb as a separate concept versus
hugetlbfs, so that hugetlb folios can be allocated by not only hugetlbfs
and other things.

Tests I've done:

- I had a reproducer in patch 1 for the bug I found, this will start to
  work after patch 1 or the whole set applied.

- Hugetlb regression tests (on x86_64 2MBs), includes:

  - All vmtests on hugetlbfs

  - libhugetlbfs test suite (which may fail some tests, but no new failures
    will be introduced by this series, so all such failures happen before
    this series so shouldn't be relevant).


This patch (of 7):

Since commit 04f2cbe35699 ("hugetlb: guarantee that COW faults for a
process that called mmap(MAP_PRIVATE) on hugetlbfs will succeed"),
avoid_reserve was introduced for a special case of CoW on hugetlb private
mappings, and only if the owner VMA is trying to allocate yet another
hugetlb folio that is not reserved within the private vma reserved map.

Later on, in commit d85f69b0b533 ("mm/hugetlb: alloc_huge_page handle
areas hole punched by fallocate"), alloc_huge_page() enforced to not
consume any global reservation as long as avoid_reserve=true.  This
operation doesn't look correct, because even if it will enforce the
allocation to not use global reservation at all, it will still try to take
one reservation from the spool (if the subpool existed).  Then since the
spool reserved pages take from global reservation, it'll also take one
reservation globally.

Logically it can cause global reservation to go wrong.

I wrote a reproducer below, trigger this special path, and every run of
such program will cause global reservation count to increment by one, until
it hits the number of free pages:

  #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <fcntl.h>
  #include <errno.h>
  #include <unistd.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <sys/mman.h>

  #define  MSIZE  (2UL << 20)

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      const char *path;
      int *buf;
      int fd, ret;
      pid_t child;

      if (argc < 2) {
          printf("usage: %s <hugetlb_file>\n", argv[0]);
          return -1;
      }

      path = argv[1];

      fd = open(path, O_RDWR | O_CREAT, 0666);
      if (fd < 0) {
          perror("open failed");
          return -1;
      }

      ret = fallocate(fd, 0, 0, MSIZE);
      if (ret != 0) {
          perror("fallocate");
          return -1;
      }

      buf = mmap(NULL, MSIZE, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                 MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);

      if (buf == MAP_FAILED) {
          perror("mmap() failed");
          return -1;
      }

      /* Allocate a page */
      *buf = 1;

      child = fork();
      if (child == 0) {
          /* child doesn't need to do anything */
          exit(0);
      }

      /* Trigger CoW from owner */
      *buf = 2;

      munmap(buf, MSIZE);
      close(fd);
      unlink(path);

      return 0;
  }

It can only reproduce with a sub-mount when there're reserved pages on the
spool, like:

  # sysctl vm.nr_hugepages=128
  # mkdir ./hugetlb-pool
  # mount -t hugetlbfs -o min_size=8M,pagesize=2M none ./hugetlb-pool

Then run the reproducer on the mountpoint:

  # ./reproducer ./hugetlb-pool/test

Fix it by taking the reservation from spool if available.  In general,
avoid_reserve is IMHO more about "avoid vma resv map", not spool's.

I copied stable, however I have no intention for backporting if it's not a
clean cherry-pick, because private hugetlb mapping, and then fork() on top
is too rare to hit.
