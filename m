6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 785953cf6e63aa5a9fcdfa9577b1411e0281c4bc ]

Starting in turbostat v2025.01.14, turbostat refused to run
on unsupported hardware, pointing to "RUN THE LATEST VERSION"
on turbostat(8).

At that time, turbostat supported and advertised the "--force"
parameter to run anyway (with unsupported results).

Also document "--force" on turbostat.8.
