The patch 70bbeb29fab0 ("dm delay: for short delays, use kthread instead 
of timers and wq") changes behavior of dm-delay from using timers to 
polling, so it may cause problems to people running legacy kernels - the 
polling consumes more CPU time than the timers - so I think it shouldn't 
go to the stable kernels where users expect that there will be no 
functional change.

Here I'm submitting the patch 6fc45b6ed921 backported for 6.6.3.

dm-delay: fix a race between delay_presuspend and delay_bio

In delay_presuspend, we set the atomic variable may_delay and then stop
the timer and flush pending bios. The intention here is to prevent the
delay target from re-arming the timer again.

However, this test is racy. Suppose that one thread goes to delay_bio,
sees that dc->may_delay is one and proceeds; now, another theread executes
delay_presuspend, it sets, dc->may_delay to zero, deletes the timer and
flushes pending bios. Now, the first thread continues and adds the bio to
delayed->list despite the fact that dc->may_delay is false.

In order to fix this bug, we change may_delay's type from atomic_t to bool
and we read and write it only while holding the delayed_bios_lock mutex.
Note that we don't have to grab the mutex in delay_resume because there
are no bios in flight at this point.
