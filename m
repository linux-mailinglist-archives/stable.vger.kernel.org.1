This is on me, I only took a "subset" of the patches tagged for stable
for this round of releases as I was facing a huge backlog of stuff
(everyone loves to wait for -rc1 for cc: stable fixes), combined with me
having travelled for 6 weeks straight for conferences which didn't allow
me a ton of time to do stable kernel work to keep on top of the pile.

The patch wasn't lost, and is still in my queue to process (along with
748 other patches) it just wasn't obvious that there was a dependancy
and that I had to take them both in order, that's on me, sorry.  This is
also why we have review, to catch things when I do something stupid like
this :)

Agreed, that wouldn't really work, and isn't normally needed.

But again, maybe trying to get patches that are cc: stable into Linus
_before_ -rc1 is better?  Hey, I can dream...

thanks,
