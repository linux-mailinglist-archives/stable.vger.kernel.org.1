Well, maybe the only thing that needs to be done is backporting

8de7606f0fe2 cpuidle: menu: Eliminate outliers on both ends of the sample s=
et

(along with the dependencies) because if the workload tends to produce

cause C1 to be selected more often after commit 85975daeaa4d
("cpuidle: menu: Avoid discarding useful information").
