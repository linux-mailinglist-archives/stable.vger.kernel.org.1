Not really, no.  The information I was missing is that these Device IDs
are unique to the SoC and will never appear in a Thunderbolt-attached
device.

Fair enough, I'm sorry I led you down the wrong path with that
suggestion.  I guess no_d3cold is generally only useful for the
"D3cold is known to be broken *permanently*" use case.  Incidentally,
there's only a single driver in the tree calling pci_d3cold_enable()
and that's i915.  And it likewise disables and re-enables the flag at
the Root Port, just like you did.

Thanks,

Lukas
