Sigh. It is not that we don't care - in fact, I've already told Linus W
(as author of the commit causing your issue - who you should have Cc'd
on this report) that this needs to be fixed so that the behaviour that
userspace sees doesn't change - as per kernel rules.

However, what I'm also pointing out is that your use case results in
behaviours that can't be relied upon in userspace to work from an
architectural point of view, and that have historically always produced
a kernel alert message - thus are slow - and I'd say by intention
because BPKT has never actually been supported.

If one disables PERF_EVENTS in the kernel configuration, you won't
even get the SIGTRAP for BKPT, but instead get a SIGBUS. That is also
how the kernel would handle BKPT propr to 3rd September 2010 (v2.6.37)
even with PERF_EVENTS enabled.

Hence, the raising of SIGTRAP instead of SIGBUS can also be regarded as
a regression /if/ someone pop up and say that they're relying on that
behaviour - and if that were to be reported, under kernel rules, that
regression would also need to be fixed, which means that generating
SIGTRAP for BKPT no longer becomes possible, and thus your program
breaks - but the historical nature of the older behaviour wins out.

So, what I'm saying is that your program is relying on unstable
foundations here, but let me be clear: because you have reported the
change of behaviour, it will get fixed. We just can't guarantee that
it will remain fixed for the reasons I've pointed out in my various
emails to you.

Sadly, that's what happens when every i isn't dotted and every t isn't
crossed when it comes to "features" that the CPU supports but the
kernel doesn't.

Let me also be clear: I expect Linus W to fix this - firstly, his
commit introduced the breakage, and secondly, I have little time at
the moment to do any kernel hacking (ongoing long term family issues.)

It is documented as I have pointed out in the architecture reference
manuals. It is not the kernel's job to document architectural details.

I suspect that the CFI fault code was a decision by compiler authors,
but I can't say because I don't have a setup that generates the code
for CFI.
