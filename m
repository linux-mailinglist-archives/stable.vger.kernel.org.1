[ Upstream commit 6510b62fe9303aaf48ff136ff69186bcfc32172d ]

snprintf() returns the number of characters that *would* have been
written, which can overestimate how much you actually wrote to the
buffer in case of truncation. That leads to 'data += this' advancing
the pointer past the end of the buffer and size going negative.

Switching to scnprintf() prevents potential buffer overflows and ensures
consistent behavior when building the output string.

Summary
- Replaces snprintf with scnprintf in nvkm_snprintbf to prevent pointer
  over-advancement and out-of-bounds NUL writes on truncation.
- Small, contained, behavior-preserving fix across widely used
  debug/interrupt logging paths in Nouveau.

Technical Analysis
- Problematic code path:
  - In nvkm_snprintbf, the loop builds a space-separated list of bit
    names: drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/core/enum.c:45–55.
  - It uses snprintf to append:
    drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/core/enum.c:47–50.
  - After each append, it advances the pointer by the return value and
    reduces size: drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/core/enum.c:49–50.
  - On exit, it writes a trailing NUL at the current pointer:
    drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/core/enum.c:55.
- Bug mechanism:
  - snprintf returns the number of characters that would have been
    written (excluding NUL) even when truncated.
  - If the buffer is near full (e.g., size == 1), snprintf returns a
    value > 0, causing size to go negative and data to advance past the
    end of the buffer, so the final data[0] = '\0' writes out-of-bounds
    (drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/core/enum.c:55).
- Fix rationale:
  - scnprintf returns the number of characters actually written into the
    buffer, bounded by size-1 and always consistent with the
    pointer/data movement.
  - Replacing snprintf with scnprintf at
    drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/core/enum.c:47 guarantees that size
    tracking and pointer advancement remain in-bounds and that the final
    NUL write is safe.
- API availability:
  - scnprintf is a long-standing kernel helper declared in
    include/linux/sprintf.h:15, so it exists across stable series.

Impact and Usage Context
- nvkm_snprintbf is used widely to format error/interrupt bitfields into
  human-readable strings (numerous call sites):
  - Example: drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/engine/gr/gf100.c:1239 (char
    error[128];) and subsequent use of nvkm_snprintbf(error,
    sizeof(error), ...) to log errors.
  - Other examples include:
    drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/engine/gr/nv50.c:272,
    drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/engine/gr/nv40.c:271–273,
    drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/ltc/gf100.c:103,
    drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/ltc/gm107.c:82.
- While buffers are typically 64–128 bytes, concatenating multiple bit
  names can still reach truncation boundaries. The current code can then
  over-advance and perform an OOB NUL write. This is memory corruption
  (albeit a single byte) on the kernel stack and should be fixed.

Risk/Regression Assessment
- Change scope is a one-line replacement local to the function; no
  API/ABI change.
- scnprintf semantics match the intended logic of “advance by what we
  wrote,” preventing negative size and pointer overflow.
- Behavior under truncation improves: instead of corrupting memory, the
  function simply yields a properly NUL-terminated string with as much
  content as fits.
- No architectural changes; only string formatting mechanics inside a
  helper used for logging and diagnostics.

Stable Backport Criteria
- Fixes a real bug that can corrupt memory (stack OOB write) in common
  code paths.
- Minimal, self-contained, and low-risk change.
- Not a feature addition; purely correctness/safety.
- Touches only the Nouveau driver helper; broad benefit across many call
  sites without side effects.
- No special dependencies; scnprintf is present across stable kernels.

Backport Notes
- Function prototype remains unchanged:
  drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/include/nvkm/core/enum.h:21.
- Ensure include paths bring in scnprintf (declared in
  include/linux/sprintf.h:15). Nouveau’s headers already include
  standard Linux headers via drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/include/nvif/os.h
  which pulls core kernel headers, so no additional includes are needed.

Conclusion
- This is a classic correctness/safety fix that prevents a subtle but
  real OOB write. It is small, contained, and aligns with stable policy.
  Backporting is recommended.
