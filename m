From: Ryan Roberts <ryan.roberts@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit f12b435de2f2bb09ce406467020181ada528844c ]

Commit a166563e7ec37 ("arm64: mm: support large block mapping when
rodata=full") enabled the linear map to be mapped by block/cont while
still allowing granular permission changes on BBML2_NOABORT systems by
lazily splitting the live mappings. This mechanism was intended to be
usable by realm guests since they need to dynamically share dma buffers
with the host by "decrypting" them - which for Arm CCA, means marking
them as shared in the page tables.

However, it turns out that the mechanism was failing for realm guests
because realms need to share their dma buffers (via
__set_memory_enc_dec()) much earlier during boot than
split_kernel_leaf_mapping() was able to handle. The report linked below
showed that GIC's ITS was one such user. But during the investigation I
found other callsites that could not meet the
split_kernel_leaf_mapping() constraints.

The problem is that we block map the linear map based on the boot CPU
supporting BBML2_NOABORT, then check that all the other CPUs support it
too when finalizing the caps. If they don't, then we stop_machine() and
split to ptes. For safety, split_kernel_leaf_mapping() previously
wouldn't permit splitting until after the caps were finalized. That
ensured that if any secondary cpus were running that didn't support
BBML2_NOABORT, we wouldn't risk breaking them.

I've fix this problem by reducing the black-out window where we refuse
to split; there are now 2 windows. The first is from T0 until the page
allocator is inititialized. Splitting allocates memory for the page
allocator so it must be in use. The second covers the period between
starting to online the secondary cpus until the system caps are
finalized (this is a very small window).

All of the problematic callers are calling __set_memory_enc_dec() before
the secondary cpus come online, so this solves the problem. However, one
of these callers, swiotlb_update_mem_attributes(), was trying to split
before the page allocator was initialized. So I have moved this call
from arch_mm_preinit() to mem_init(), which solves the ordering issue.

I've added warnings and return an error if any attempt is made to split
in the black-out windows.

Note there are other issues which prevent booting all the way to user
space, which will be fixed in subsequent patches.
