Well, if I didn't speak up chances are we wouldn't have identified the
regression in the MDS at all.  People seem to have this perception that
the client is somehow "easier" to fix, assume that the server is always
doing the right thing and default to patching the client.  I'm just
trying to push back on that.

In this particular case, after understanding the scope of the issue
_and_ getting a committal for the MDS side fix, I approved taking the
kernel client patch in an earlier reply.

No, it's invoked outside: it introduces a "op !=3D CEPH_SNAP_OP_SPLIT"
branch.

Thanks,
