6.1-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: David Jeffery <djeffery@redhat.com>

commit c467e97f079f0019870c314996fae952cc768e82 upstream.

During a reshape or a RAID6 array such as expanding by adding an additional
disk, I/Os to the region of the array which have not yet been reshaped can
stall indefinitely. This is from errors in the stripe_ahead_of_reshape
function causing md to think the I/O is to a region in the actively
undergoing the reshape.

stripe_ahead_of_reshape fails to account for the q disk having a sector
value of 0. By not excluding the q disk from the for loop, raid6 will always
generate a min_sector value of 0, causing a return value which stalls.

The function's max_sector calculation also uses min() when it should use
max(), causing the max_sector value to always be 0. During a backwards
rebuild this can cause the opposite problem where it allows I/O to advance
when it should wait.

Fixing these errors will allow safe I/O to advance in a timely manner and
delay only I/O which is unsafe due to stripes in the middle of undergoing
the reshape.
