Subject: ocfs2: reject dinodes with non-canonical i_mode type or stray bits
Date: Sun, 17 May 2026 07:10:12 -0400

Patch series "ocfs2: harden inode validators against forged metadata".

This series adds three structural checks to ocfs2_validate_inode_block()
that catch attacker-controlled bytes in a freshly read dinode before
ocfs2_populate_inode() copies them verbatim into the in-core inode.  All
three checks fire on the mount, lookup, and read-after-cache-invalidation
paths and reject the block with ocfs2_error(), the same error-propagation
mechanism the existing suballoc-slot, inline-data, chain-list, and
refcount checks use.

Direction
=========

This continues the validator-hardening direction visible in the
recent in-flight ocfs2_validate_inode_block hardening series,
e.g. ZhengYuan Huang's "ocfs2: revalidate the journal dinode
before toggling dirty"
(<20260512024115.4036371-1-gality369@gmail.com>), "ocfs2: add
extent tree depth validation"
(<20260416110229.3283682-1-gality369@gmail.com>), and "ocfs2:
add extent list validation v2"
(<20260423094116.876696-1-gality369@gmail.com>).  Each of those
adds a per-field invariant check against bytes that downstream
code paths trust unconditionally.

The three checks in this series cover three more fields whose
attacker-controlled values currently propagate into VFS-visible state
without question: i_mode (type bits and reserved bits), i_rdev
(cross-checked against the file type), and the i_size / i_clusters pairing
for regular files on non-sparse volumes (patch 3 is gated on
!ocfs2_sparse_alloc(); sparse- allocation mounts legitimately commit
i_size > 0 with i_clusters == 0 via ocfs2_zero_extend()).

Threat model
============

The validator is the chokepoint that protects ocfs2_populate_inode() from
a malformed dinode whether the malformation got there via:

  (1) An attacker-supplied disk image mounted by a privileged
      user.  The mount path runs every dinode through this
      validator before any unprivileged user opens a file on
      the volume.  This is the same threat model the existing
      inline-data, refcount, and chain-list checks in this
      function were written for.

  (2) A compromised cluster peer with raw write access to the
      shared block device.  OCFS2 is a clustered filesystem;
      the on-disk blocks behind bh->b_data live on shared
      storage that other cluster nodes can write.  The local
      node's cache-eviction re-read runs the newly fetched
      block through this validator before ocfs2_populate_inode()
      runs again.  Oracle's BlockErrorDetection design document
      scopes the existing CRC32 + Hamming integrity primitive
      explicitly as defense against memory and wire corruption,
      not as authentication of peer writes; the field-level
      validators are therefore the kernel-side defense
      whichever path produced the forged block.

The three checks in this series are deliberately structural: they each
express an invariant mkfs.ocfs2 and the kernel maintain unconditionally,
and they reject any dinode whose header violates that invariant before its
bytes propagate to the in-core inode.

Scope note: these checks block forge patterns that touch i_mode (outside
the canonical envelope), i_rdev (on a non-device file), or the i_size /
i_clusters pair (regular file with size but no extents, on non-sparse
volumes only).  A forger who keeps the dinode within these structural
envelopes (for example, flipping only the permission bits and uid/gid on a
regular file that already has clusters allocated) can still produce a
dinode that satisfies the field-level invariants; closing that residual
class is outside the scope of this hardening series.

Validation
==========

Each patch builds on top of the previous one against mainline; the series
as a whole builds clean against v7.1-rc1 with zero new warnings. 
checkpatch --strict reports 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 checks for each patch.

The series was exercised on a two-node QEMU cluster (virtio-blk
shared LUN with share-rw=on, both nodes joining the same o2cb
cluster, mounted ocfs2 with metaecc):

  - Pre-series baseline: a peer-node raw-write forge that adds
    S_ISUID and flips uid/gid to 0 on a regular file is accepted
    by the existing validator chain; the unprivileged user on
    the victim node exec()s the file and gains euid=0.  This
    confirms the cluster-peer write primitive is reachable in
    today's mainline.  Per the Scope note above, this particular
    forge stays within the structural envelope these patches
    enforce and is NOT blocked by them; closing it requires the
    out-of-scope keyed-integrity work.
  - Post-series, structural-variant forge: a peer-node forge
    that, in addition to the setuid + uid/gid changes, stores
    i_rdev = MKDEV(1,1) on the same regular-file dinode (the
    cleanest cluster-context attacker primitive patch 2
    catches) is rejected by ocfs2_validate_inode_block() with
    ocfs2_error "non-device mode 0104755 with i_rdev N".  The
    buffer-head propagates -EFSCORRUPTED to
    ocfs2_read_locked_inode and the user-visible result is
    Permission denied on subsequent stat / open / exec of the
    forged file.  Analogous post-series forge variants that
    flip i_mode outside the canonical envelope, or that set
    i_size > 0 with i_clusters == 0 on a non-inline regular
    file mounted from a non-sparse volume, are rejected by
    patches 1 and 3 respectively.

A separate cluster regression (mount, peer-write a regular file,
drop_caches on the second node, read it back) runs clean post-series, so
the checks do not regress normal operation.

In-tree selftests under tools/testing/selftests/ that reference
fs/ocfs2/inode.c or any changed symbol were checked; no matching selftests
exist for ocfs2_validate_inode_block(), which is consistent with OCFS2
having no in-tree selftest coverage.  The subsystem's standard regression
coverage is xfstests (the generic fs group) plus ocfs2-test, both out of
tree.  Those were not run as part of this series; a full xfstests pass
before merge is recommended and I am happy to run a representative subset
and report results if reviewers would find it useful.


This patch (of 3):

ocfs2_validate_inode_block() currently accepts any 16-bit i_mode value as
long as i_mode is non-zero.  ocfs2_populate_inode() then copies that mode
verbatim into inode->i_mode and dispatches on i_mode & S_IFMT to the
file/dir/symlink/special_file iops; any unrecognised type falls through to
ocfs2_special_file_iops and init_special_inode(), which interprets
id1.dev1.i_rdev as a device number.

The result is that anything able to forge or corrupt an inode block (a
hostile cluster peer with raw write access to the shared LUN, a privileged
user mounting an attacker-supplied image, on-disk corruption) can publish
an in-core inode whose type bits do not name a POSIX file type, or whose
permission bits carry bytes outside S_IFMT|07777.  Both shapes propagate
into VFS-visible state that downstream code paths assume is well-formed.

Reject early in the validator:

  - mode bits outside S_IFMT|07777
  - S_IFMT values that are not one of S_IFREG, S_IFDIR, S_IFLNK,
    S_IFCHR, S_IFBLK, S_IFIFO, S_IFSOCK

mkfs.ocfs2 and the kernel only ever produce these seven types plus the
standard permission, setuid/setgid/sticky bits; an on-disk i_mode outside
this envelope is structurally malformed regardless of how it got there.

Validated against the existing inline_data, refcount, and chain-list
checks: this hardening fires before any of them and does not perturb their
behaviour for well-formed inodes.
