6.6-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

commit 10fad4012234a7dea621ae17c0c9486824f645a0 upstream.

It is reported that commit 85975daeaa4d ("cpuidle: menu: Avoid discarding
useful information") led to a performance regression on Intel Jasper Lake
systems because it reduced the time spent by CPUs in idle state C7 which
is correlated to the maximum frequency the CPUs can get to because of an
average running power limit [1].

Before that commit, get_typical_interval() would have returned UINT_MAX
whenever it had been unable to make a high-confidence prediction which
had led to selecting the deepest available idle state too often and
both power and performance had been inadequate as a result of that on
some systems.  However, this had not been a problem on systems with
relatively aggressive average running power limits, like the Jasper Lake
systems in question, because on those systems it was compensated by the
ability to run CPUs faster.

It was addressed by causing get_typical_interval() to return a number
based on the recent idle duration information available to it even if it
could not make a high-confidence prediction, but that clearly did not
take the possible correlation between idle power and available CPU
capacity into account.

For this reason, revert most of the changes made by commit 85975daeaa4d,
except for one cosmetic cleanup, and add a comment explaining the
rationale for returning UINT_MAX from get_typical_interval() when it
is unable to make a high-confidence prediction.
