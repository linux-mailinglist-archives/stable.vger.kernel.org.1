Yes, so we can suppress the "Starting disk" message for runtime resume, to match
the runtime suspend not having the message.

The patch is not *that* broken, because sd_do_start_stop() returning false mean
only that the disk will *not* be started using a START STOP UNIT command. But
the underlying LLD must start the drive. So the message is not wrong, even
though it is probably best to suppress it for the runtime case.

The point here is that sd_runtime_resume() should NOT be called every 5s unless
there is also a runtime suspend in between the calls. As mentioned, this can
happen if the autosuspend timer is set to a very low timeout to aggressively
suspend the disk after a short idle time. That of course makes absolutely no
sense for HDDs given the spinup time needed, but I guess that is a possiblity
for UFS drives.

OK. so let's revert this patch and I will rework that message to be displayed
only on device removal, system suspend and system shutdown.

Not really. As mentioned above, it is probably best to suppress the start/stop
messages for runtime suspend. The separate discussion is why sd_runtime_resume
is called that often for this UFS drive: bug or aggressive autosuspend ? Given
that I do not have this hardware, I will let someone else look into that.
