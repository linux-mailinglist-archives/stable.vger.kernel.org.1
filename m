Looks like Sasha just dropped the offending commit from the 5.10 and
5.15 queues (but forgot to drop some dep-of patches, I'll go fix that
up), so I'll also drop the patch from the 6.1.y queue as well to keep
things in sync.

If you all want this change to be in 6.1.y (or any other tree), can you
provide a working backport, with this patch merged into it?
