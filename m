20 patches is trivial for us to handle, please do it that way as it
ensures we keep the proper history, AND we know what to backport when in
the future.

When you try to crunch patches together, or do non-upstream changes,
90%+ of the time they end up being wrong or impossible to maintain over
time.

Why add new features to older kernels?  That's not going to be ok,
sorry.

And why is can adding module parameters?  This isn't the 1990's, we have
proper ways of doing this correctly (hint, module parameters are not the
way to do that...)
