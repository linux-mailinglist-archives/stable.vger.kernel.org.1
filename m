I'll note that at boot, getting the Pi to see the NAS requires some nudging of avahi-autoipd; while I think it's stable before testing, I'm not positive, and reconnection issues might be in play.

I checked 607aea3cc2a8, it just removed some code in #if 0 ... #endif.
so this regression is not introduced in 607aea3cc2a8,  but the reproduce
frequency is changed here.


Another issue in 6.6.y maybe related
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/9e8f8872-f51b-4a09-a92c-49218748dd62@meta.com/T/

Do this regression still happen after the following patches are applied?

a60cc288a1a2 :Luis Chamberlain: test_xarray: add tests for advanced multi-index use
a08c7193e4f1 :Sidhartha Kumar: mm/filemap: remove hugetlb special casing in filemap.c
6212eb4d7a63 :Hongbo Li: mm/filemap: avoid type conversion

de60fd8ddeda :Kairui Song: mm/filemap: return early if failed to allocate memory for split
b2ebcf9d3d5a :Kairui Song: mm/filemap: clean up hugetlb exclusion code
a4864671ca0b :Kairui Song: lib/xarray: introduce a new helper xas_get_order
6758c1128ceb :Kairui Song: mm/filemap: optimize filemap folio adding
