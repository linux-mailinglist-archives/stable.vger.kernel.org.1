commit d0afcfeb9e3810ec89d1ffde1a0e36621bb75dca upstream.

A new on by default warning in clang [1] aims to flags instances where
const variables without static or thread local storage or const members
in aggregate types are not initialized because it can lead to an
indeterminate value. This is quite noisy for the kernel due to
instances originating from header files such as:

  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gt/intel_ring.h:62:2: error: default initialization of an object of type 'typeof (ring->size)' (aka 'const unsigned int') leaves the object uninitialized [-Werror,-Wdefault-const-init-var-unsafe]

Silencing the instances from typecheck.h is difficult because '= {}' is
not available in older but supported compilers and '= {0}' would cause
warnings about a literal 0 being treated as NULL. While it might be
possible to come up with a local hack to silence the warning for
clang-21+, it may not be worth it since -Wuninitialized will still
trigger if an uninitialized const variable is actually used.

In all audited cases of the "field" variant of the warning, the members
are either not used in the particular call path, modified through other
means such as memset() / memcpy() because the containing object is not
const, or are within a union with other non-const members.

Since this warning does not appear to have a high signal to noise ratio,
just disable it.
