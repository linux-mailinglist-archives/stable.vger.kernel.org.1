[ Upstream commit 2afe17794cfed5f80295b1b9facd66e6f65e5002 ]

It's supposed to be COUNTER_MAX / 2, not COUNTER_MAX.

Now I have a clear understanding. Let me analyze the specific code
change in the commit:

**YES**

This commit should be backported to stable kernel trees. Here's my
extensive analysis:

## Analysis of the Bug Fix

### 1. The Bug
The code in `md_bitmap_new_disk_sb()` incorrectly validates
`write_behind` against `COUNTER_MAX` instead of `COUNTER_MAX / 2`:

```c
- if (write_behind > COUNTER_MAX)
+       if (write_behind > COUNTER_MAX / 2)
                write_behind = COUNTER_MAX / 2;
```

### 2. Why This is a Real Bug

The comment immediately above this code explicitly states:
```c
/*
 - FIXME: write_behind for RAID1.  If not specified, what
 - is a good choice?  We choose COUNTER_MAX / 2 arbitrarily.
 */
```

The intent is clearly to limit write_behind to `COUNTER_MAX / 2`, but
the validation check was incorrectly comparing against `COUNTER_MAX`.
This creates an inconsistency where:
- Values between `COUNTER_MAX / 2` and `COUNTER_MAX` would pass the
  check
- But then get clamped to `COUNTER_MAX / 2` anyway
- This means the validation isn't serving its intended purpose

### 3. Impact on Users

This bug affects:
- **dm-raid users**: When creating new bitmap superblocks for RAID
  arrays with write-behind configured
- **Data consistency**: While not causing data corruption, it creates
  confusion about the actual limits
- **Configuration validation**: Users might set values that appear to be
  accepted but are silently reduced

### 4. Consistency with Other Code

The fix aligns with the pattern used elsewhere:
- In `dm-raid.c`: The validation correctly checks `value / 2 >
  COUNTER_MAX` (equivalent check for sector-based values)
- The clamping value of `COUNTER_MAX / 2` is consistently used as the
  default throughout the codebase

### 5. Backport Criteria

This commit meets the stable kernel backport criteria:
- **It fixes a bug**: Incorrect validation logic that doesn't match the
  intended behavior
- **Simple and contained**: One-line change with minimal risk
- **Clear fix**: The correct value is obvious from the surrounding code
  and comment
- **User-visible impact**: Affects configuration validation for dm-raid
  users

### 6. Similar Historical Commits

Looking at the similar commits provided:
- Commit #1 (backported): Added validation to prevent setting
  max_write_behind without write-mostly devices
- Commit #4 (backported): Fixed missing bitmap updates with write-mostly
  devices

Both of these were backported and dealt with correctness issues in the
write-behind functionality, establishing a pattern that such fixes are
considered stable-worthy.

### 7. Risk Assessment

- **Low risk**: Single character change ('/' to '/ 2')
- **Well-understood**: The correct limit is documented in the comment
- **No ABI changes**: Just tightens an existing validation check
- **Fail-safe**: Makes the validation more restrictive, not less

## Conclusion

This is a clear bug fix that corrects an incorrect validation check to
match the documented and intended behavior. The fix is trivial, safe,
and addresses a real issue that affects dm-raid users. It should be
backported to ensure consistent behavior across stable kernel versions.
