I listed 2 issues in the commit log; I agree that issue 1 falls into the
category of "don't really care", but issue 2 means that kstack randomization is
currently trivial to defeat. That's the reason I thought it would valuable in
stable.

But if you're saying don't bother and others agree, then this whole patch can be
dropped; this is just intended to be the backportable fix. Patch 3 reimplements
this entirely for upstream.

I'll wait and see if others have opinions if that's ok?

Yeah, I spent a bit of time with pahole but eventually concluded that it was
difficult to find somewhere to nestle it that would work reliably cross arch.
Eventually I just decided to group it with other stack meta data.

For more recent kernels it's 6 bits shifted by 4 for 64-bit kernels or 8 bits
shifted by 2 for 32-bit kernels regardless of arch. So could probably make it
work with 8 bits of storage. Although I was deliberately trying to keep the
change simple, since it was intended for backporting. Patch 3 rips it out.

Overall I'd prefer to leave it all as is. But if people don't think we should
backport, then let's just drop the whole patch.

Thanks,
Ryan
