So it's a bug that the kernel needs to work around, that's fine.  But
that implies it should go to "all" stable kernels that it can, right?

I can not poarse this, sorry.  We can't do anything about people who
don't use our kernel trees, so what does this mean?

As it is "cc: stable" that implies that it should get to Linus for
6.10-final, not wait for 6.11-rc1 as the 6.11 release is months away,
and anyone who has this issue would want it fixed sooner.
