Please spell out these reasons so that we can determine if they are

This is not just an issue with an i2c retimer, this is a plain generic
bug in that the glink code which is calling drivers while their devices
are suspended.

Which clients? Do we care enough about them to be papering over this
very real bug which can potentially crash the system (e.g. due to
unclocked register accesses)?

This is incomplete at best, even as a stop gap. I just threw a
dump_stack() in qmp_combo_typec_switch_set() and see that it is being
called four times (don't ask me why) from two different workers on
hotplug.

Even if you use the freezable workqueue for altmode notifications, you
can still end up here via the ucsi notifications, and that now also
seems to generate a warning in the PM code during resume.

When you first brought up the possible workaround of using a freezable
workqueue, I mistakenly thought this would apply to all glink messages
(I realise that would defeat the purpose of allowing some early
notifications).

You've also found that the glink interrupts are waking up the system
unconditionally on battery notifications, which would be yet another
reason for disabling the interrupts (or implementing some kind of
masking).

I'm leaning towards just disabling the glink interrupts during suspend,
but that depends a bit on what (historical?) functionality actually need
them.
