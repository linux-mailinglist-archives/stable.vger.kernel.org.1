Feels really good to hear this, as it was a lot of work that involved a
lot of rewriting...

Nevertheless: let me know, if there is something where you think "this
doesn't feel right", "this could be clearer", "I don't understand this",
or something like that.

Well, bugs in general I'd say.

Yeah, but where? I wondered if I should ask Jonathan if this is
something for lwn.net, but something in me says it would be a odd fit.

I'd really like to work more on that, but this regression tracking thing
is a time sink. And regzbot still needs quite a few improvements as
well. :-/

Would help if I finally would figure out how to use "git clone" to
create a clone or two of myself. ;)

Well said. It's similar for regression tracking, hence let me remove it
from the list of tracked issues

#regzbot inconclusive: seems nobody is motivated enough to work on
resolving this issue found by KernelCI (see lists for details).

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
