I thought it had been established that the "crypto" grouping of features
(as implemented by gcc and clang) doesn't reflect the actual hardware
feature fields and is misleading because additional crypto extensions
continue to be added.

I'm not sure that applies here, but just something to consider.

There's certainly no need to support emulating combinations of features
that no hardware actually implements.  So yes, if that means "crypto" is
the right choice, that sounds fine.
