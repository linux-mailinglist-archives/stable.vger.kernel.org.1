I hope I'll have the proper RK3308 thermal configuration available
for the 6.14 merge window, also with higher OPPs in place.  Knowing
that we've seemingly had no RK3308 SoCs releasing the magic smoke
(yet? :), I think we can keep the status quo for a couple of months
or so, so let's drop this patch.

Thanks again to Jonas for all the stress testing!
