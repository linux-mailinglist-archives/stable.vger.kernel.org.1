Yes, I found very few binaries that do actually do a full setresuid().

We have been working on a sudo replacement that requests permission from
a more privileged process via ipc for a long time. We've implemented it
and it speaks varlink and run0 can be used as a drop-in replacement for
sudo. We keep adding the bits and pieces to function as a sudo
replacement in most cases:

https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/42465

setuid will die (outside of unprivileged containers) and we're getting
very close to making that happen.
