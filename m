5.10-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Florent Revest <revest@chromium.org>

commit c12296bbecc488623b7d1932080e394d08f3226b upstream.

In __team_options_register, team_options are allocated and appended to
the team's option_list.
If one option instance allocation fails, the "inst_rollback" cleanup
path frees the previously allocated options but doesn't remove them from
the team's option_list.
This leaves dangling pointers that can be dereferenced later by other
parts of the team driver that iterate over options.

This patch fixes the cleanup path to remove the dangling pointers from
the list.

As far as I can tell, this uaf doesn't have much security implications
since it would be fairly hard to exploit (an attacker would need to make
the allocation of that specific small object fail) but it's still nice
to fix.
