Nope, not at all :)

For now, I'm going to keep both commits in the stable trees, as that
matches what is in Linus's tree as this seems to be hard to reproduce
and I haven't seen any other reports of issues.  Being in sync with what
is in Linus's tree is almost always good, that way if a fix happens
there, we can easily backport it to the stable trees too.

So unless the maintainer(s) say otherwise, I'll just let this be.

thanks,
