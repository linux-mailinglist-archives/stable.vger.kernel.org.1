6.1-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

[ Upstream commit be45bc4eff33d9a7dae84a2150f242a91a617402 ]

Enable/disable local IRQs, i.e. set/clear RFLAGS.IF, in the common
svm_vcpu_enter_exit() just after/before guest_state_{enter,exit}_irqoff()
so that VMRUN is not executed in an STI shadow.  AMD CPUs have a quirk
(some would say "bug"), where the STI shadow bleeds into the guest's
intr_state field if a #VMEXIT occurs during injection of an event, i.e. if
the VMRUN doesn't complete before the subsequent #VMEXIT.

The spurious "interrupts masked" state is relatively benign, as it only
occurs during event injection and is transient.  Because KVM is already
injecting an event, the guest can't be in HLT, and if KVM is querying IRQ
blocking for injection, then KVM would need to force an immediate exit
anyways since injecting multiple events is impossible.

However, because KVM copies int_state verbatim from vmcb02 to vmcb12, the
spurious STI shadow is visible to L1 when running a nested VM, which can
trip sanity checks, e.g. in VMware's VMM.

Hoist the STI+CLI all the way to C code, as the aforementioned calls to
guest_state_{enter,exit}_irqoff() already inform lockdep that IRQs are
enabled/disabled, and taking a fault on VMRUN with RFLAGS.IF=1 is already
possible.  I.e. if there's kernel code that is confused by running with
RFLAGS.IF=1, then it's already a problem.  In practice, since GIF=0 also
blocks NMIs, the only change in exposure to non-KVM code (relative to
surrounding VMRUN with STI+CLI) is exception handling code, and except for
the kvm_rebooting=1 case, all exception in the core VM-Enter/VM-Exit path
are fatal.

Use the "raw" variants to enable/disable IRQs to avoid tracing in the
"no instrumentation" code; the guest state helpers also take care of
tracing IRQ state.

Oppurtunstically document why KVM needs to do STI in the first place.
