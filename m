Ok, I think we are talking about two different things here.

Point 3 you mentioned is about modifying TDs on the ring, and then continue.
And you are right, xHC should in this case invalidate all future TDs, but
not the current one it stopped on.

I'm talking about point 2, about aborting the current TD where we know
we are queuing a "Set TR Deq" command. Same section states that
Set TD Deq may be used to force xHC to dump any internal state it has for
the ring.

If this is how xHC behaves on failed Set TR Deq commands, then yes,
TRB errors are possible.

But if xHC does clear TD cache on failed Set TR Deq command then it's
smooth sailing.

If we don't turn the TD to no-op then xHC is more likely to write to
freed DMA address in both cases above, which I think is worse.

Unfortunately no, this patch is an attempt to mitigate the issue seen in
"Strange issues with USB device" [1]. That discussion continued off-list
with a lot more testing and debugging, but I ran out of testing goodwill
before I came up with this partial solution.
