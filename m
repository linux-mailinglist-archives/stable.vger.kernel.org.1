Yes, if there is another revision.

Ok, thanks for confirming.

I think it would be good to include this (without the time stamp) as an
example as it would make it easier to find this fix even if the failure
happens for another service.

Yes, but using the in-kernel pd-mapper has exposed a number of existing
bugs since it changes the timing of events enough to make it easier to
hit them.

The audio regression is a very real regression for users of Snapdragon
based laptops like, for example, the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x.

If Bjorn has confirmed that this is the same issue (I can try to
instrument the code based on your analysis to confirm this too), then I
think it would be good to mention this in the commit message and link to
the report, for example:

	This specifically also fixes an audio regression when using the
	in-kernel pd-mapper as that makes it easier to hit this race. [1]

	Link: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Zqet8iInnDhnxkT9@hovoldconsulting.com/ # [1]

or similar.
