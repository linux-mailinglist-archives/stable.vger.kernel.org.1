The quilt patch titled
     Subject: mm: do not reclaim private data from pinned page
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-do-not-reclaim-private-data-from-pinned-page.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into the mm-hotfixes-stable branch
of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Subject: mm: do not reclaim private data from pinned page
Date: Fri, 28 Apr 2023 14:41:40 +0200

If the page is pinned, there's no point in trying to reclaim it. 
Furthermore if the page is from the page cache we don't want to reclaim
fs-private data from the page because the pinning process may be writing
to the page at any time and reclaiming fs private info on a dirty page can
upset the filesystem (see link below).
