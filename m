Unlikely but not impossible.
We already turn all cancelled TDs that we don't stop on into no-ops, so those
would already now experience the same problem.

We stopped the endpoint, and issued a 'Set TR deq' command which is supposed
to clear xHC TRB cache.  I find it hard to believe xHC would continue
by caching some select TRBs of a TD to cache.

But lets say we end up corrupting the TD. It might still be better than
allowing xHC to process the TRBs and write to DMA addresses that might be
freed/reused already.

This should not be an issue.
We don't queue a 'Set TR Deq' command if we intend to continue processing
a stopped TD, as the 'Set TR Deq' is designed to dump all transfer related
state of the endpoint.

We need to give back the cancelled URB at some point, and 'Set TR Deq'
command completion is the latest reasonable place to do it.

After this we should prevent xHC hw from accessing URB DMA pointers.
