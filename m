Let me rephrase it to "a decision made within the driver" (vs.
globally decided). That could be hardcoded (for now) or as match data
based on compatible.

Possibly. What's correct here?

There was some rework in 6.11 of the interrupt parsing. So it is
possible something changed here. There's also this issue still
pending:

There's a lot of history and the interrupt parsing is fragile due to
all the "interesting" DT interrupt hierarchies. So while I think it
would work, that's just a guess. I'm open to trying it and seeing.
