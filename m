Yeah, so the commit in question works as intended and from a purely
cpuidle standpoint it is an improvement.

However, for the system/workload combination in question, cpuidle
really is used as a means to crank up single-thread CPU performance.

Honestly, I'm not really sure what to do about this.  It looks like
this workload might benefit from selecting C6 more often, but I'm not
quite sure how to make that happen in a generic way.  Also, it may
regress other workloads.
