True, and it's also unable to look into cxacru_upload_firmware() :)

That's what a follow-on patch would generate thinking they were actually
fixing a bug, but again, that's a pointless check!

I have no idea what Android uses for their compiler.  Usually when they
run into issues like this, for their 'allmodconfig' builds, they just
apply a "CONFIG_BROKEN" patch to disable the old/unneeded driver
entirely.

I'm really loath to take it, sorry.  I'd prefer that if the compiler
can't figure it out, we should rewrite it to make it more "obvious" as
to what is going on here so that both people, and the compiler, can
understand it easier.

Just setting the variable to NULL does neither of those things, except
to shut up a false-positive, not making it more obvious to the compiler
as to what really is going on.
