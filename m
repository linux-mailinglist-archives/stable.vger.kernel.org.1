Thats a fair point. I'll add "LLM Analysis:" before the explanation to
future patches.

Just like in the past 8 years where AUTOSEL ran without any explanation
whatsoever, the patches are manually reviewed and tested prior to being
included in the stable tree.

I don't make a point to go back and correct the justification, it's
there more to give some idea as to why this patch was marked for
review and may be completely bogus (in which case I'll drop the patch).

For that matter, I'd often look at the explanation only if I don't fully
understand why a certain patch was selected. Most often I just use it as
a "Yes/No" signal.

In this instance I honestly haven't read the LLM explanation. I agree
with you that the explanation is flawed, but the patch clearly fixes a
problem:

	"On AMD dGPUs this can lead to failed suspends under memory
	pressure situations as all VRAM must be evicted to system memory
	or swap."

So it was included in the AUTOSEL patchset.

Do you have an objection to this patch being included in -stable? So far
your concerns were about the LLM explanation rather than actual patch.

Good point. I'm not really sure what messes up the line wraps. I'll take
a look.

The filter is based on authorship and SoBs. Individual maintainers of a
subsystem can elect to have their entire subsystem added to the ignore
list.
