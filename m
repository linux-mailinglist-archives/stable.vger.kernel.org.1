Thanks!

It applies on top of
"[PATCH] fscrypt: Fix key setup in edge case with multiple data unit sizes"
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20260618180652.52742-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/).
This time I tried just relying on the prerequisite-patch-id footer (as
generated by 'git format-patch') to express the dependency.  But
evidently that still doesn't work: for one, 'b4 am' just ignores it.

Since this patch has "Reported-by: syzbot" as well as "Fixes", the
stable maintainers will apply it anyway.  If I actually wanted to stop
that, I'd have to actively oppose the backport, likely multiple times
indefinitely since people will continue to try to backport it.  And
syzkaller would continue to get the lockdep warning on stable kernels.

So I'd rather just get it out the way and backport it the same time as
"fscrypt: Fix key setup in edge case with multiple data unit sizes",
which similarly tweaks some data structures in struct fscrypt_master_key
and needs to be backported too.  "fscrypt: stop using keyrings subsystem
for fscrypt_master_key" several years ago was backported too.
