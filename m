Hi all,

That's how C works. It is not how Rust works. Rust does not reject using floats 
ever. Instead, Rust offers softfloat targets where you can still use floats, but 
it won't use float registers. Obviously, that needs to use a different ABI.
As you said, aarch64 does not have an official softfloat ABI, but LLVM 
implements a de-facto softfloat ABI if you ask it to generate functions that 
take/return float types while disabling the relevant target features. (Maybe 
LLVM should just refuse to generate such code, and then Rust may have ended up 
with a different design. But now this would all be quite tricky to change.)

As explained above, f32/f64 were already accepted as function parameters and 
return values in Rust code before this change. So this patch does not change 
anything here. (In fact, the ABI used for these functions should be exactly the 
same before and after this patch.)

Rust's softfloat targets do not use FP/SIMD registers by default. Ideally these 
targets allow selectively using FP/SIMD registers within certain functions; for 
aarch64, this is not properly supported by LLVM and therefore Rust.

> AIUI, this change does something different.

Having targets without float support would be a significant departure from past 
language decisions in Rust -- that doesn't mean it's impossible, but it would 
require a non-trivial effort (starting with an RFC to lay down the motivation 
and design).

Kind regards,
Ralf
