6.6-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Umesh Nerlige Ramappa <umesh.nerlige.ramappa@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit ee11d2d37f5c05bd7bf5ccc820a58f48423d032b ]

On XEHP platforms user is not able to find MMIO triggered reports in the
OA buffer since i915 squashes the context ID fields. These context ID
fields hold the MMIO trigger markers.

Update logic to not squash the context ID fields of MMIO triggered
reports.
