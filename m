[ Upstream commit b4cc1cbba5195a4dd497cf2f8f09e7807977d543 ]

Some masters may drive the transfers with low enough latency between
the nak/stop phase of the current command and the start/address phase
of the following command that the interrupts are coalesced by the
time we process them.
Handle the stop conditions before processing SLAVE_MATCH to fix the
complaints that sometimes occur below.

"aspeed-i2c-bus 1e78a040.i2c-bus: irq handled != irq. Expected
0x00000086, but was 0x00000084"
