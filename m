Every now and then one should afford to be nice.

It is not the first time our installation was hit by an unnecessarily missing catch-all clause that triggered an assert or follow-up crash for no real reason.

There is some kind of follow-up condition that is triggered only under heavy load and almost certainly only at a time when a snapshot is taken. Hence, it is very well possible that many if not all users have these invalid snaptrace message on their system, but nothing else happens so they don't report anything.

Others might not encounter these conditions simultaneously on their system as often as we do.
