You all marked the commit as a fix for an issue, so that's why we
backported all of this.  If something is NOT a fix, don't tag it as
such?  :)

Or, if you want, we can ignore all patches in the gpio subsystem that
are NOT explicitly tagged with a cc: stable@ tag, if you agree that you
will properly tag everything.  Some other subsytems do this, but that
increases the responsibility on the maintainers of the subsystem, which
is not something I would ever ask anyone to do.

Heck, for my subsystems, I miss tagging stable a lot, but the scripts
pick up those that get Fixes: tags, so it's a good back-stop to solve
problems.

Again, if you want us to ignore any portion of the tree that you are the
maintainer, just let me know the directory(ies) that you want and I can
add it to the "ignore list" or you can send a patch for this file:
	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/stable-queue.git/tree/ignore_list

thanks!
