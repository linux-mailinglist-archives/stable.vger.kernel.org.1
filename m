-Binding for the axi-clkgen clock generator
-
-This binding uses the common clock binding[1].
-
-[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
-
-Required properties:
-- compatible : shall be "adi,axi-clkgen-1.00.a" or "adi,axi-clkgen-2.00.a".
-- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; Should always be set to 0.
-- reg : Address and length of the axi-clkgen register set.
-- clocks : Phandle and clock specifier for the parent clock(s). This must
-	either reference one clock if only the first clock input is connected or two
-	if both clock inputs are connected. For the later case the clock connected
-	to the first input must be specified first.
-
-Optional properties:
-- clock-output-names : From common clock binding.

-		reg = <0xff000000 0x1000>;
