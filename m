Lo! Top-posting on purpose to make this easy to process.

What happened to this regression? It looks a bit like things stalled and
fell through the cracks. Or Fernando, did you post a patch like you
mentioned? I looked for one referring the commit or the reporter, but
could not find anything -- but maybe I missed it.

Ciao, Thorsten
