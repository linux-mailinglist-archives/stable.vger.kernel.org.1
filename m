Yeah, but nothing prevented an user from powering on the endpoint later and
doing manual rescan.

Ah yes, this one was *before* the ASPM discussion we had.

The patch makes sure that the pwrctrl doesn't power off the endpoint when
'struct pci_dev' gets destroyed. But thinking more, I'm not sure if that's
what happenning during the 'of_irq_parse_pci' issue.

I need to dig more at some point.
