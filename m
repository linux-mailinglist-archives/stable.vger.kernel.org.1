Subject: mm: avoid unsafe VMA hook invocation when error arises on mmap hook
Date: Wed, 23 Oct 2024 21:38:26 +0100

Patch series "fix error handling in mmap_region() and refactor", v2.

The mmap_region() function is somewhat terrifying, with spaghetti-like
control flow and numerous means by which issues can arise and incomplete
state, memory leaks and other unpleasantness can occur.

A large amount of the complexity arises from trying to handle errors late
in the process of mapping a VMA, which forms the basis of recently observed
issues with resource leaks and observable inconsistent state.

This series goes to great lengths to simplify how mmap_region() works and
to avoid unwinding errors late on in the process of setting up the VMA for
the new mapping, and equally avoids such operations occurring while the VMA
is in an inconsistent state.

The first four patches are intended for backporting to correct the
possibility of people encountering corrupted state while invoking mmap()
which is otherwise at risk of happening.

After this we go further, refactoring the code, placing it in mm/vma.c in
order to make it eventually userland testable, and significantly
simplifying the logic to avoid this issue arising in future.


This patch (of 4):

After an attempted mmap() fails, we are no longer in a situation where we
can safely interact with VMA hooks.  This is currently not enforced,
meaning that we need complicated handling to ensure we do not incorrectly
call these hooks.

We can avoid the whole issue by treating the VMA as suspect the moment
that the file->f_ops->mmap() function reports an error by replacing
whatever VMA operations were installed with a dummy empty set of VMA
operations.

We do so through a new helper function internal to mm - mmap_file() -
which is both more logically named than the existing call_mmap() function
and correctly isolates handling of the vm_op reassignment to mm.

All the existing invocations of call_mmap() outside of mm are ultimately
nested within the call_mmap() from mm, which we now replace.

It is therefore safe to leave call_mmap() in place as a convenience
function (and to avoid churn).  The invokers are:

     ovl_file_operations -> mmap -> ovl_mmap() -> backing_file_mmap()
    coda_file_operations -> mmap -> coda_file_mmap()
     shm_file_operations -> shm_mmap()
shm_file_operations_huge -> shm_mmap()
            dma_buf_fops -> dma_buf_mmap_internal -> i915_dmabuf_ops
	                    -> i915_gem_dmabuf_mmap()

None of these callers interact with vm_ops or mappings in a problematic way
on error, quickly exiting out.
