My apologies, you're right. Somehow I checked that this dtpm_cpu.c
was introduced in v5.10. It was in v5.12 indeed. I messed that up.

Also, the code in that v5.12 had different implementation and there was
a function cpuhp_dtpm_cpu_offline() which had the cpufreq_cpu_get().

I can craft for that v5.12 special extra patch fix addressing it and
send directly to stable list. Would that make sense?

So this patch would only be applicable for v5.16+ AFAICS.

Regards,
Lukasz
