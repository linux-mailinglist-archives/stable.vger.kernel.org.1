There are some architectural rules around which combinations of crypto
extensions are permitted:
- PMULL implies AES, and there is no way for the ID registers to
describe a CPU that has PMULL but not AES
- SHA256 implies SHA1 (but the ID register fields are independent)
- SHA3 and SHA512 both imply SHA256+SHA1
- SVE versions are not allowed to be implemented unless the plain NEON
version is implemented as well
-  FEAT_Crypto has different meanings for v8.0, v8.2 and v9.x

So it would be much easier, also in terms of future maintenance, to
have a simple 'crypto=off' setting that applies to all emulated CPU
models, given that disabling all crypto on any given compliant CPU
will never result in something that the architecture does not permit.

Would that work for you?
