I'm not asking for details on why it's FAILED.  I'm asking for commits
that cherry-pick cleanly to not be FAILED in the first place.

I've been doing stable backports for a long time, and it's happened
*many* times that something cherry-picks cleanly for me but you say
there are "conflicts".  Here's an example from just 2 weeks ago where
you spent time "resolving" a "conflict" in commits that actually
cherry-picked cleanly:

And sometimes the "owners" don't do it and other people involved in the
subsystem need to do it.  Or the backports are wrong and other people
involved in the system need to point that out.  It's not much different
from any other kernel development; it should be done on the lists.
