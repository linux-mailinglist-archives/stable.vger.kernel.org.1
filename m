Subject: mm/mglru: fix underprotected page cache
Date: Thu, 7 Dec 2023 23:14:04 -0700

Unmapped folios accessed through file descriptors can be underprotected. 
Those folios are added to the oldest generation based on:

1. The fact that they are less costly to reclaim (no need to walk the
   rmap and flush the TLB) and have less impact on performance (don't
   cause major PFs and can be non-blocking if needed again).
2. The observation that they are likely to be single-use. E.g., for
   client use cases like Android, its apps parse configuration files
   and store the data in heap (anon); for server use cases like MySQL,
   it reads from InnoDB files and holds the cached data for tables in
   buffer pools (anon).

However, the oldest generation can be very short lived, and if so, it
doesn't provide the PID controller with enough time to respond to a surge
of refaults.  (Note that the PID controller uses weighted refaults and
those from evicted generations only take a half of the whole weight.) In
other words, for a short lived generation, the moving average smooths out
the spike quickly.

To fix the problem:
1. For folios that are already on LRU, if they can be beyond the
   tracking range of tiers, i.e., five accesses through file
   descriptors, move them to the second oldest generation to give them
   more time to age. (Note that tiers are used by the PID controller
   to statistically determine whether folios accessed multiple times
   through file descriptors are worth protecting.)
2. When adding unmapped folios to LRU, adjust the placement of them so
   that they are not too close to the tail. The effect of this is
   similar to the above.

On Android, launching 55 apps sequentially:
                           Before     After      Change
  workingset_refault_anon  25641024   25598972   0%
  workingset_refault_file  115016834  106178438  -8%
