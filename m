Many thx for this, let me follow suit a bit.

Yeah, my situation is quite similar -- just that I'm not the reporter
and instead someone supposed to handle the tracking. But just like you I
sometimes do a bit more than the job description in the strict sense
requires. That msg you replied to was written in one of those moments. :-D

But FWIW, I have lines I don't cross myself (or at least try to).
Submitting fixes myself for example, even if they are simple -- like
patches adding quirk entries to resolve regressions (recently I
nevertheless got close to ignore that line, but then found a better
solution...).

Definitely. Maybe I should have CCed them in my mail, but I didn't, as
that the point where I thought "the reporter is the better judge here".

Yeah, maybe.

But OTOH I think we (e.g. reporters and developers) are all volunteers
here (e.g. as hobbyist or because our employer wants us to contribute).
Volunteers with a common goal. And all of us only have 24 hours in a day
(at least as far as I know) -- which is often not enough to get
everything done one is supposed to do. That in an ideal world should not
affect duties like "fix any regressions you caused". But well, we don't
live in an ideal world.

That's why I sometimes ignore the strict role definitions and also
wonder if defining them is worth it. But it's totally fine for me if
someone wants to do that.


That might sound a bit like a speech I'm giving trying to convince you
to follow my model. But be assured: that's not the case at all. After
your words I just felt I wanted to share my view on things.

Maybe that's because this is afaics a situation where a regression
likely will remain unfixed, unless some of us do a bit more than what is
expected from them. That's because I guess most people don't care much
about 4.14.y anymore -- either in general or on the particular platform
affected by this regression.

That leads to the question: should we spend our time on it? Maybe the
time would better be spend on more important things, even if that means
this particular regressions then likely will remain unfixed in 4.14.y.
Heck, maybe we should define that such an outcome is totally fine in
cases like this -- not sure, but I currently think leaving that
undefined might be better approach for the project as a whole.

Ciao, Thorsten
