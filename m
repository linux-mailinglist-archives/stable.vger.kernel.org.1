The burden is not there to do that, this came in from the AUTOSEL stuff.
It was sent to everyone on Jan 26:
	https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250126150720.961959-3-sashal@kernel.org
so there was 1 1/2 weeks chance to say something before Sasha committed
it to the stable queue.  Then it was sent out again here in the -rc
releases for review, for anyone to object to.

So there was 3 different times someone could have said "no, this isn't
ok for stable inclusion" before it was merged.  And even if that's not
enough, I'll be glad to revert it if it wasn't ok to be merged at any
time afterward.

thanks,

greg k-h
