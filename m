This definition is only needed for a workaround which is only applicable
to v6.18+ (and the downstream android16-6.12 tree).

We needn't backport this patch to v5.1.0.y unless there's something that
depends upon it.

>   l/20260302165801.3014607-1-catalin.marinas@arm.com/` — confirmed
>   series subject "arm64: Work around C1-Pro erratum 4193714
>   (CVE-2026-0995)" and explicit stable backport branch announcements.
> - [Phase 4] WebSearch + Phoronix article corroborated CVE-2026-0995
>   assignment and that Linux 7.1 merged the workaround.
> - [Phase 4] Web-fetched v5 thread at
>   `yhbt.net/lore/.../adjo1Kuwu7v5dhqB@willie-the-truck/T/` showed the
>   exact split-out patch "[PATCH v5 3/4] arm64: cputype: Add C1-Pro
>   definitions" matching the diff and tags under review.
> - [Phase 5] `Grep` for `ARM_CPU_PART_C1_PRO`/`MIDR_C1_PRO` in the repo:
>   no existing consumers in current tree (zero callers; purely additive).
> - [Phase 6] `git log stable/linux-6.17.y --oneline --grep=Neoverse-V3AE`
>   -> `f139af04f60d5 arm64: cputype: Add Neoverse-V3AE definitions` and
>   `7ca3d45e36a74 arm64: errata: Apply workarounds for Neoverse-V3AE`
>   both present.
> - [Phase 6] `git log stable/linux-6.12.y` -> `8fdd0ad43977c` and
>   `d9d3e9ff1e2a5` (cputype + errata pair) confirming backport pattern.
> - [Phase 6] `git log stable/linux-6.6.y` -> `f3ccb49186541` and
>   `6de6d315f34c5` (cputype + errata pair).
> - [Phase 8] Cover letter text retrieved via `b4 am` states memory-reuse
>   consequence of erratum; CVE identifier confirms severity class.
> - UNVERIFIED: I could not programmatically reach lore.kernel.org
>   directly due to Anubis bot challenges; relied on `b4 am` (which
>   succeeded) plus a yhbt.net mirror for the v5 thread. This does not
>   affect the decision — the v5 thread content matches the commit under

> Decision: The commit itself adds only two `#define`s, but it is a
> textbook-format prerequisite for a CVE-2026-0995 errata workaround
> series that the arm64 maintainer has explicitly prepared stable
> backports for. Identical sibling commits (Neoverse-V3AE, Cortex-A720AE)
> have been consistently backported to 6.6.y / 6.12.y / 6.17.y alongside
> their errata fixes. Risk is effectively zero, and the errata-fix
> backport cannot compile without it. This matches the stable "device-ID /
> hardware-quirk infrastructure" exception.
