Subject: [PATCH] driver core: Don't let a device probe until it's ready

The moment we link a "struct device" into the list of devices for the
bus, it's possible probe can happen. This is because another thread
can load the driver at any time and that can cause the device to
probe. This has been seen in practice with a stack crawl that looks
like this [1]:

  really_probe()
  __driver_probe_device()
  driver_probe_device()
  __driver_attach()
  bus_for_each_dev()
  driver_attach()
  bus_add_driver()
  driver_register()
  __platform_driver_register()
  init_module() [some module]
  do_one_initcall()
  do_init_module()
  load_module()
  __arm64_sys_finit_module()
  invoke_syscall()

As a result of the above, it was seen that device_links_driver_bound()
could be called for the device before "dev->fwnode->dev" was
assigned. This prevented __fw_devlink_pickup_dangling_consumers() from
being called which meant that other devices waiting on our driver's
sub-nodes were stuck deferring forever.

It's believed that this problem is showing up suddenly for two
reasons:
1. Android has recently (last ~1 year) implemented an optimization to
   the order it loads modules [2]. When devices opt-in to this faster
   loading, modules are loaded one-after-the-other very quickly. This
   is unlike how other distributions do it. The reproduction of this
   problem has only been seen on devices that opt-in to Android's
   "parallel module loading".
2. Android devices typically opt-in to fw_devlink, and the most
   noticeable issue is the NULL "dev->fwnode->dev" in
   device_links_driver_bound(). fw_devlink is somewhat new code and
   also not in use by all Linux devices.

Even though the specific symptom where "dev->fwnode->dev" wasn't
assigned could be fixed by moving that assignment higher in
device_add(), other parts of device_add() (like the call to
device_pm_add()) are also important to run before probe. Only moving
the "dev->fwnode->dev" assignment would likely fix the current
symptoms but lead to difficult-to-debug problems in the future.

Fix the problem by preventing probe until device_add() has run far
enough that the device is ready to probe. If somehow we end up trying
to probe before we're allowed, __driver_probe_device() will return
-EPROBE_DEFER which will make certain the device is noticed.

In the race condition that was seen with Android's faster module
loading, we will temporarily add the device to the deferred list and
then take it off immediately when device_add() probes the device.

Instead of adding another flag to the bitfields already in "struct
device", instead add a new "flags" field and use that. This allows us
to freely change the bit from different thread without worrying about
corrupting nearby bits (and means threads changing other bit won't
corrupt us).
