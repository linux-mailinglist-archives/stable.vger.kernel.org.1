/me makes a not that it might make sense to enhance the tracing to show
which of the trace_block_unplug call sites did a particular unplug because
that might be helpful here, but I suspect the ones you saw the ones
from blk_mq_dispatch_plug_list, which now gets bypassed.

I'm not really sure how that changed things, except that I know in
old kernels we had issues with reordering I/O in this path, and
maybe your workload hit that?  Did the issue order change in the
blktrace?

With QUEUE_FLAG_NOMERGES even very basic merging is enabled, so that
would fix any smaller amount of reordering.  It is in fact a bit
stupid that this ever got set by default on the loop driver.

I'm totally fine with backporting the patch.
