This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    serial: sc16is7xx: add check for unsupported SPI modes during probe

to my tty git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/tty.git
in the tty-next branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will also be merged in the next major kernel release
during the merge window.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: serial: sc16is7xx: add check for unsupported SPI modes during probe

The original comment is confusing because it implies that variants other
than the SC16IS762 supports other SPI modes beside SPI_MODE_0.

Extract from datasheet:
    The SC16IS762 differs from the SC16IS752 in that it supports SPI clock
    speeds up to 15 Mbit/s instead of the 4 Mbit/s supported by the
    SC16IS752... In all other aspects, the SC16IS762 is functionally and
    electrically the same as the SC16IS752.

The same is also true of the SC16IS760 variant versus the SC16IS740 and
SC16IS750 variants.

For all variants, only SPI mode 0 is supported.

Change comment and abort probing if the specified SPI mode is not
SPI_MODE_0.
