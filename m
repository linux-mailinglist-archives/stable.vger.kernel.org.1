Roughly speaking, the ~35 bugfixes can be split into three categories:

1) Our vaunted^Wshitty review process didn't catch various coding bugs,
and testing didn't trip over them until I started (ab)using precommit
hooks for spot checking of inode/dquot/buffer log items.

2) Most of the metadir/rtgroups fixes are for things that hch reworked
towards the end of the six years the patchset has been under
development, and that introduced bugs.  Did it make things easier for a
second person to understand?  Yes.

3) The rest are mostly cases of the authors not fully understanding the
subtleties of that which they were constructing (myself included!) and
lucking out that the errors cancelled each other out until someone
started wanting to use that code for a slightly different purpose, which
wouldn't be possible until the bug finally got fixed.

4) The dquot buffer changes have been a known problem since dchinner
decided that RMW cycles in the AIL with inode buffers was having very
bad effects on reclaim performance.  Nobody stepped up to convert dquots
(even though I noted this at the time) so here I am years later because
the mm got pissy at us in 6.12.

5) XFS lit up a lot of new functionality this year, which means the code
is ripe with bugfixing opportunities where cognitive friction comes into
play.

Yeah, they do.  We left behind the kindly old world where people didn't
feed computers fuzzed datafiles and nobody got fired for a computer
crashing periodically.  Nowadays it seems that everything has to be
bulletproofed AND fast. :(
