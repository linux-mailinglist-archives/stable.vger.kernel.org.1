Because on the previous platforms the apic_write(APIC_TMICT, 0) in
lapic_timer_shutdown() was sufficient even in the TSC deadline mode,
or at least no problems with it have ever been reported.

It will power down somewhat, but not as much as to justify suspending
the system.  It will just drain the battery at a relatively high rate
which will also cause the machine to heat up.

Not a good idea to put it into a bag in this state, for instance.

That is my understanding.  If you disarm it and it is not armed again,
it will be stopped effectively.

No, you are right.

We need a new version of the patch with a better changelog.
