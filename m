I guess the following blurb is new.

If you look at the code, it will return the address regardless if it is
within the kernel memory or not.

This is called when reading addresses that are in the persistent ring
buffer from a previous boot.

Before the "fix":

  It would always add the text_delta to the address.

The issue without that is that it could be adjusting a pointer that was to
allocated memory. It makes no sense to do this. The reason for doing this
adjustment is because a lot of reads of addresses use "%pS", and we care
only about getting a proper kallsyms of the address.

Thus what is done is:

		raddr =3D addr + tr->text_delta;
		return __is_kernel(raddr) || is_kernel_core_data(raddr) ||
			is_kernel_rodata(raddr) ? raddr : addr;

Which does the adjustment, and if it falls into kernel memory or data
return that adjustment, otherwise return the original address. The reason
is that by returning the adjusted memory, it may fall into a module that we
do not want to print kallsyms for.

It doesn't risk any KASLR information. All addresses used by
trace_adjust_address() is from a pointer that existed in a previous boot.
The adjustment is pretty meaningless if it's not in kernel text or data.

Yes persistent tracing is enabled across reboots and the address is from a
previous boot. It does return the actual address of the current boot to use
with %pS when it was on the kernel text or data address. When it isn't
(likely a module address) the adjustment is meaningless and may give bad
trace output at most.

If an attacker has access to trace output KASLR is already lost, as
function tracing records raw addresses and exposes everything KASLR, which
is why reading these files is a privilege operation.

I won't argue against backporting, but I just wanted to state this analysis
may not be correct.
