I mean that I took the file initially generated by git format-patch when 
I sent the patch against -next.

I updated the diff context from this file and left everything else as-is.
I only added some (apparently unclear :) ) context below the ---.


Yes, precisely.
My patch has been sent *after* 9c7174db4cdd1 in -next, and it depends on it.

The proposed modified patch for backport tries to deal with this missing 
part in older branches.

If 9c7174db4cdd1 was also backported, I think that my patch would apply 
cleanly.

I never said that.

It is one of the first time, if not the first one, I update a patch to 
ease backport.
I only sent something for 6.4.y, but it must be valid for other branches 
as well. (i.e. # v3.6+)

The way I generated this backport proposal is likely not the correct 
approach. I choose to hand modify the initial git format-patch output.
I think that I should have switched to the expected branch and apply a 
clean process from there.


Personalty, I don't really care if backported or not.
I don't use these older kernel. I don't use this hardware (AFAIK :)).
I proposed an updated patch to help, should it be helpful for you or any 
one else.

If I did it wrong, sorry for the noise.


No hard feeling, but I won't update this backport proposal, should 
something need to be fixed.

I consider I've already done my part of the job.
