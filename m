[ Upstream commit 10663044bee592ba049a2aa37f4431fbdf93b739 ]

specified explicitly, allow to set vdd-supply.

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

## Decision Summary
Backport this **with the companion DTS fix**. By itself it is a schema-
only change, but the mailing-list history verifies it was added because
the runtime DTS fix for Kontron i.MX8MP OSM RTC boot hangs was dropped
due to `dtb_check` warning: `'vdd-supply' is not allowed`. This patch is
a 2-line DT binding addition for existing hardware, reviewed by a DT
maintainer, and has essentially no runtime regression risk.

## Phase Walkthrough
1.1 Record: Subsystem `dt-bindings: rtc: microcrystal,rv3028`; action
verb `Allow`; intent is to permit `vdd-supply` in the RV3028 RTC
binding.

1.2 Record: Tags found: `Signed-off-by: Frieder Schrempf`, `Reviewed-by:
Krzysztof Kozlowski`, `Link:
https://patch.msgid.link/20260309085749.25747-2-frieder@fris.de`,
`Signed-off-by: Alexandre Belloni`. No `Fixes`, `Reported-by`, `Tested-
by`, or `Cc: stable`.

1.3 Record: Commit body says only that explicit VDD regulator
specification should be allowed. The series and v2 discussion verify the
concrete issue: the companion DTS fix adds `vdd-supply` so fw_devlink
orders PMIC before RTC, avoiding sporadic boot hangs.

1.4 Record: Hidden bug-fix context exists, but not in this patch alone.
This patch fixes a DT schema gap that blocked a real DTS boot-hang fix.

2.1 Record: One file changed,
`Documentation/devicetree/bindings/rtc/microcrystal,rv3028.yaml`; 2
lines added; no functions; single-file schema change.

2.2 Record: Before, `unevaluatedProperties: false` rejected `vdd-
supply`. After, `vdd-supply: true` permits the regulator phandle.

2.3 Record: Bug category is DT schema/build-validation fix and
prerequisite for hardware dependency expression. Not memory safety,
locking, or runtime driver logic.

2.4 Record: Fix is obviously correct and minimal. Regression risk is
very low because it only relaxes schema validation for one standard
supply property.

3.1 Record: Blame shows the binding file was introduced by
`c690048ed59b5` in `v6.3-rc1`; `#clock-cells` was added by
`4015580e983da` in `v6.12-rc1`.

3.2 Record: Candidate has no `Fixes:` tag. Companion DTS patch fixes
`946ab10e3f40f`, introduced in `v6.13-rc1`.

3.3 Record: Recent binding history only shows the file creation and
`#clock-cells` addition. The patch is standalone, but its stable value
is tied to the companion DTS fix.

3.4 Record: Author has multiple Kontron DTS fixes in local history; not
the RTC maintainer, but the patch was reviewed by Krzysztof Kozlowski
and applied by Alexandre Belloni.

3.5 Record: No code dependencies. For meaningful runtime benefit,
backport with `arm64: dts: imx8mp-kontron: Fix boot order for PMIC and
RTC`.

4.1 Record: `b4 dig -c 10663044bee5` found the original v3 patch at the
supplied lore/msgid URL. `b4 dig -a` found v1 and v3 series history; v3
added the missing binding patch.

4.2 Record: `b4 dig -w` showed relevant DT/RTC maintainers and lists
were included.

4.3 Record: v2 discussion verified Frank Li dropped the DTS fix because
it caused `dtb_check` warning: `'vdd-supply' is not allowed`; Frieder
replied that v3 adds the binding patch.

4.4 Record: Series context is 2 patches in v3: this binding patch and
the DTS boot-order fix. Binding was applied by Alexandre Belloni; DTS
fix later applied by Frank Li.

4.5 Record: I found no stable-specific discussion or explicit stable
nomination.

5.1 Record: No functions modified.

5.2 Record: No callers. Semantic impact is DT schema validation.

5.3 Record: Verified runtime relevance through OF supplier parsing:
`drivers/of/property.c` has `DEFINE_SUFFIX_PROP(regulators, "-supply",
NULL)` and includes `parse_regulators` in supplier bindings.

5.4 Record: Companion DTS path is reachable during device probing on
Kontron i.MX8MP OSM. PMIC driver enables the I2C level translator when
`nxp,i2c-lt-enable` is present; RTC node sits on the same I2C bus.

5.5 Record: Similar `vdd-supply: true` properties exist in many
bindings, including another RTC binding, `amlogic,meson6-rtc.yaml`.

6.1 Record: Binding exists from `v6.3+`; Kontron OSM DTS exists from
`v6.13+`. `v6.1` lacks the binding file.

6.2 Record: `git apply --check` succeeded on existing `v6.6` and `v6.12`
worktrees and current `v7.0.1`; `v6.1` fails because the file does not
exist. A separate v6.19 temporary worktree attempt ran out of space
before testing, so direct v6.19 apply was not verified.

6.3 Record: No related stable fix already found in local history.

7.1 Record: Subsystem is DT binding documentation for RTC hardware;
criticality is peripheral, but it supports a board boot-hang fix.

7.2 Record: Subsystem/file is low churn: only binding creation and
`#clock-cells` addition before this patch.

8.1 Record: Affected population is users/builders of RV3028 DTs,
especially Kontron i.MX8MP OSM users when paired with the DTS fix.

8.2 Record: Trigger for the companion bug is boot/probe ordering where
RTC is accessed before PMIC enables the I2C level shifter. Trigger for
this patch alone is DT schema validation with `vdd-supply`.

8.3 Record: Candidate alone fixes a build/validation warning. Companion
failure mode is sporadic boot hang, which is critical for affected
hardware.

8.4 Record: Benefit is high when paired with the companion DTS fix, low
if isolated. Risk is very low: two schema lines, no runtime code.

9.1 Record: For backporting: tiny, reviewed, applies cleanly to relevant
trees, enables a verified hardware boot-hang fix, standard DT supply
property. Against: schema-only and no standalone runtime fix.

9.2 Record: Stable rules: obviously correct yes; real user bug
indirectly yes via companion DTS fix; important issue yes when paired,
boot hang; small yes; no runtime API/new driver yes; applies to
v6.6/v6.12/current, not v6.1.

9.3 Record: Exception category applies: DT binding addition for existing
hardware / build-validation support.

9.4 Record: Decision is YES, but it should be treated as a
prerequisite/companion to the DTS boot-order fix, not as a standalone
runtime fix.

## Verification
- Phase 1: Parsed supplied commit message and local b4 mbox; confirmed
  tags and absence of `Fixes`/stable tags.
- Phase 2: Read diff and current binding file; confirmed only `vdd-
  supply: true` is added.
- Phase 3: Used `git blame`, `git describe --contains`, and file
  history; confirmed binding introduction in `v6.3-rc1`, `#clock-cells`
  in `v6.12-rc1`, board DTS in `v6.13-rc1`.
- Phase 4: Used `b4 am`, `b4 mbox`, `b4 diff`, `b4 dig -a`, and `b4 dig
  -w`; verified v2 rejection due dtb_check warning and v3 addition of
  this binding patch.
- Phase 5: Searched/read OF supplier parsing and PCA9450 code; verified
  `*-supply` creates supplier links and PMIC `nxp,i2c-lt-enable` enables
  the I2C level translator.
- Phase 6: Checked stable tags/worktrees; apply check passes on v6.6,
  v6.12, and current tree; v6.1 lacks the file.
- Phase 7/8: Verified affected paths in Kontron DTS and binding; no
  runtime code touched.
- Unverified: Direct apply check on v6.19 due temporary worktree
  checkout failure, though v6.19 file contents were inspected and match
  the expected context.

**YES**
