[ Upstream commit ea4d453b9ec9ea279c39744cd0ecb47ef48ede35 ]

With TBKAS on, the completion of one command can defer sending a
keep alive for up to twice the delay between successive runs of
nvme_keep_alive_work. The current delay of KATO / 2 thus makes it
possible for one command to defer sending a keep alive for up to
KATO, which can result in the controller detecting a KATO. The following
trace demonstrates the issue, taking KATO = 8 for simplicity:

1. t = 0: run nvme_keep_alive_work, no keep-alive sent
2. t = ε: I/O completion seen, set comp_seen = true
3. t = 4: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see comp_seen == true,
          skip sending keep-alive, set comp_seen = false
4. t = 8: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see comp_seen == false,
          send a keep-alive command.

Here, there is a delay of 8 - ε between receiving a command completion
and sending the next command. With ε small, the controller is likely to
detect a keep alive timeout.

Fix this by running nvme_keep_alive_work with a delay of KATO / 4
whenever TBKAS is on. Going through the above trace now gives us a
worst-case delay of 4 - ε, which is in line with the recommendation of
sending a command every KATO / 2 in the NVMe specification.
