I went back and did some more reverse engineering and have now confirmed
that the hardware works as I assumed for v1, that is, that cancelling a
command leaves data in the fifo, which is later discarded when a new
command is issued.

I'm keeping the watermark level unchanged in v2 and instead restart tx
by issuing a short transfer command to clear any stale data from the
fifo which could prevent the watermark interrupt from firing.
