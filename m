Well, you have stable-queue which is getting closer to that.

what makes you think that distros will want to pick even less tested
or validated commits ? Right now we know that some distros cherry-pick
just what they see fit and they miss important fixes, probably based on
lack of trust of a well-exposed set of patches that compose a version.
If you refine the granularity, there will be even less trust in the
level of test of each commit and they might wait even longer to pick
fixes at all.

This model at least gives a good indication of how late your system is
(the last number roughly corresponds to the number of weeks past the
release). It also offers opportunities to maintainers to voice in
saying "not this patch" or "pick that one with it" even if it does
not happen that often. And it increases the exposure on patches
combinations to more users. The finer your granulary, the less tested
each combination is. Here the current model sets discrete points in
time where many users deploy the same version hence the same set of
patches. This is particularly important and it has allowed many times
in the past to quickly spot a regression that would have taken much
longer to be noticed if everyone would deploy at a different point.

I see it the opposite way: those who don't want to follow stable branches
already don't wait for patches to land into -stable to have them, and
those who follow it will have even less reasons to trust aggregates on
which they have no feedback at all.

So in fact you're just proposing to move the testing more on the distro
side hence to fragment it.

Given that nothing prevents them from doing this already, surely if they
don't do it it's because it's an extra effort that doesn't solve any
problem ?

That's already the case, usually they have different version numbering.

That's an orthogonal aspect. Some tools are happy with the immediate
availability of these tarballs, and if they are ever considered wasteful,
they will probably stop being produced/archived or they might be deleted
after some time. But many users just download incremental patches.

All of this sounds very strange to me personally, more like a solution
looking for a problem.
