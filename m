Great questions, I was waiting for something like this to eventually
happen :)

Ideally, we would just backport the "delete the code" changes, and then
distros can use your external module for their older systems, if they
care/want to, BUT that will increase the load on you to support older
kernel versions, which isn't very fair for you as in the end, you will
be getting bizarre requests from dead^Wenterprise distros asking you to
support 10+ year old kernels...

So let's try the other way, yes, I'll gladly take patches that you have
applied to your tree to fix issues in older kernels.  One request,
please use the same git id that you use in your repo as the "backported
from" git id that is in the stable message, so that we can track them
properly across different stable releases (the ecosystem has lots of
tools that rely on this.)

As for the format, whatever works for you is fine for us.  Ideally a
mbox full of patches, but we can take anything as long as we can
eventually turn it into a patch that we can apply.  How about trying one
set of backports first so we can see how well the process works to
smooth out the details?

Oh, and of course, thanks for stepping up and offering to do this work,
it's much appreciated.
