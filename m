Heh, yeah, but I was really talking about uart_fifo_timeout() doing
unnecessary calculations on each call (and that value used to be
calculated once and stored for later use).

I also realised that we need to account for the intermediate register
after I wrote the initial commit message, and before that this was just
a shift and add.

Indeed, and the early console code also hardcodes this to 16.

I don't care about the slop being 20 ms or 23.5, this is just a timeout
for the error case.

This will over count a bit if there is uart hw with 256 B fifos, but
could potentially undercount if there is hw with less than 16 words. I'm
not sure if such hw exists, but I'll see what I can find out.

I don't think uart_fifo_timeout traditionally accounts for the shift
register and we wait up to *twice* the time it takes to clear to fifo
anyway (in wait_until_sent). The intermediate register I found here
could perhaps be considered part of the fifo however.

I'll give this some more thought.
