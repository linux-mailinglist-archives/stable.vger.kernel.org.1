This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    serial: core: set missing supported flag for RX during TX GPIO

to my tty git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/tty.git
in the tty-testing branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will be merged to the tty-next branch sometime soon,
after it passes testing, and the merge window is open.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

If the RS485 feature RX-during-TX is supported by means of a GPIO set the
according supported flag. Otherwise setting this feature from userspace may
not be possible, since in uart_sanitize_serial_rs485() the passed RS485
configuration is matched against the supported features and unsupported
settings are thereby removed and thus take no effect.
