I agree, this whacks only one mole, but it's reasonable to expect that
there are more hidden here.

The underlying problem is that GLINK register its interrupt as
IRQF_NO_SUSPEND (for historical reasons) and as such incoming messages
will be delivered in late suspend and early resume. In this specific
case, a specific message is handled by pmic_glink_altmode_callback(), by
invoking schedule_work() which in this case happens to schedule
pmic_glink_altmode_worker before we've resumed the I2C controller. 

I presume with your suggestion about a pmic_glink bus driver we'd come
up with some mechanism for pmic_glink to defer these messages until
resume has happened?

As you suggest, I too suspect that we have more of these hidden in other
rpmsg client drivers.


In the discussions leading up to this patch we agreed that a better
solution would be to change GLINK (SMEM) to not deliver messages when
the system is suspended. But as this has an impact on how GLINK may or
may not wake up the system, Abel's fix is a reasonable stop-gap solution
while we work that out.

That said, this backstory, the description of the actual underlying
problem, the planned longevity (shortgevity?) of this fix are missing
from the commit message. As written, we could expect a good Samaritan to
come in and replicate this fix across all those other use cases,
contrary to the agreed plans.


@Abel, can you please make sure that your commit message captures those
aspects as well?
