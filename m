6.16-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

commit 51888393cc64dd0462d0b96c13ab94873abbc030 upstream.

For all practical purposes, there is no difference between the situation
in which a given device is not ignoring children and its active child
count is nonzero and the situation in which its runtime PM usage counter
is nonzero.  However, pm_runtime_get_if_in_use() will only increment the
device's usage counter and return 1 in the latter case.

For consistency, make it do so in the former case either by adjusting
pm_runtime_get_conditional() and update the related kerneldoc comments
accordingly.
