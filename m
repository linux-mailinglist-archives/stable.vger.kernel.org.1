[ Upstream commit a0f5a630668cb8b2ebf5204f08e957875e991780 ]

In preparation of the endpoint MHI support, let's move the host MHI code
to its own "host" directory and adjust the toplevel MHI Kconfig & Makefile.

While at it, let's also move the "pci_generic" driver to "host" directory
as it is a host MHI controller driver.
