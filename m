[ Upstream commit bea87657b5ee8e6f18af2833ee4b88212ef52d28 ]

The rendered version of the MPTCP events [1] looked strange, because the
whole content of the 'doc' was displayed in the same block.

It was then not clear that the first words, not even ended by a period,
were the attributes that are defined when such events are emitted. These
attributes have now been moved to the end, prefixed by 'Attributes:' and
ended with a period. Note that '>-' has been added after 'doc:' to allow
':' in the text below.

The documentation in the UAPI header has been auto-generated by:

  ./tools/net/ynl/ynl-regen.sh
