What kind of reset?  FLR?  SBR?  This needs to be specified in the
commit message so that the reader isn't forced to sift through a
bugzilla with dozens of comments and attachments.

The commit message should also mention the type of affected device
(Nvidia GPU AD107M [GeForce RTX 4050 Max-Q / Mobile]).  The Root Port
above is an AMD one, that may be relevant as well.

This approach won't work if the reset is performed without software
intervention.  E.g. if a DPC event occurs, the device likewise undergoes
a reset but there is no prior system software involvement.  Software only
becomes involved *after* the reset has occurred.

I think it needs to be tested if that same issue occurs with DPC.
It's easy to simulate DPC by setting the Software Trigger bit:

setpci -s 00:01.1 ECAP_DPC+6.w=40:40

If the issue does occur with DPC then this fix isn't sufficient.

So why are you citing the PME messages here?  Are they relevant?
Do they not occur when the bandwidth controller is disabled?
If they do not, they may provide a clue what's going on.
But that's not clear from the commit message.

Instead of putting this in the PCI core, amend pcie_portdrv_err_handler
with ->reset_prepare and ->reset_done callbacks which call down to all
the port service drivers, then amend bwctrl.c to disable/enable
interrupts in these callbacks.

So why do you need to count this?  IIUC you get two consecutive
disable and two consecutive enable events.

If the interrupts are already disabled, just do nothing.
Same for enablement.  Any reason this simpler approach
doesn't work?

Thanks,

Lukas
