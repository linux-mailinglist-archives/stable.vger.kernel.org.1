Note the ASPM regression for ath11k/ath12k only happened in 6.15, so
commit b458ff7e8176 ("PCI/pwrctl: Ensure that pwrctl drivers are probed
before PCI client drivers") in 6.13 does not seem to be the immediate
culprit here.

Candidates from 6.15 include commits like

	957f40d039a9 ("PCI/pwrctrl: Move creation of pwrctrl devices to pci_scan_device()")
	2489eeb777af ("PCI/pwrctrl: Skip scanning for the device further if pwrctrl device is created")

This is probably related to the reports of these drivers sometimes
failing to probe with

	ath12k_pci 0004:01:00.0: of_irq_parse_pci: failed with rc=134

after pwrctrl was merged, and which since 6.15 should instead result in
the drivers not probing at all (as we've discussed off list).

So whatever form this fix ends up taking it only needs to be backported
to 6.15.

As you mention above these platforms do not support hotplug, but even if
they were, enabling ASPM for hotplugged devices is arguably more of a
new features than a bug fix.
