As the original author of this patch I don't feel this patch is any 
different than any other patch in that regard.
I don't write in a commit message the expected risk of a patch.

There are always people that find interesting ways to exercise it and 
they could find problems that I didn't envision.

TBH - I didn't include stable in the commit message with the intent that 
after this baked a cycle or so that we could bring it back later if 
AUTOSEL hadn't picked it up by then.

It's a real issue people have complained about for years that is 
non-obvious where the root cause is.

Once we're all confident on this I'd love to discuss bringing it back 
even further to LTS kernels if it's viable.
