Thanks for a quick and detailed reply. That's really appreciated. I need 
to clarify. I'm not a hardcore kernel developer at all, I just touch it 
a little bit occasionally, for random reasons. Debugging the situation 
thoroughly so as to find and prove the cause is far beyond my capability 
and also not exactly my personal or professional interest. I also don't 
need any sort of support (i.e. as a client) - I've already repaired and 
validated/restored from backups almost everything now, and I can just 
stick at 5.15.167 for basically as long as I like.

On the other hand, having buggy kernels (to the point of ext4 fs 
corruption) published as suitable for wide general use is not a good 
thing in my book, therefore I believe in the case of reasonable suspects 
I must at least raise a warning about it, and if I can somehow 
contribute to tracking the problem I'll do what I'm able to.

Not going to argue, but it'd seem if 5.15 is totally out of interest 
already, why keep patching it? And as long as it keeps receiving 
patches, supposedly they are backported and applied to stabilize, not 
damage it? Ok, nevermind :-)

Yes. That is why I spent 2 days for solely testing hardware, booting 
from separate media, stressing everything, and making plenty of copies. 
As I mentioned in my initial post, this had revealed no hardware issues. 
And I'm enjoying md raid-1 since around 2003 already (Not on this device 
though). I can post all my "smart" values as is, but I can assure they 
are perfectly fine for both raid-1 members. I encounter faulty hdds 
elsewhere routinely so its not something unseen too.

#smartctl -a /dev/nvme0n1 | grep Spare
Available Spare:                    100%
Available Spare Threshold:          10%

#smartctl -a /dev/sda | grep Sector
Sector Sizes:     512 bytes logical, 4096 bytes physical
   5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   100   100   050    Pre-fail Always 
       -       0
197 Current_Pending_Sector  0x0032   100   100   000    Old_age   Always 
       -       0

I have a copy of the entire ext4 partition taken immediately as mount 
first failed, it is ~800Gb and may contain some sensitive data so I 
cannot just hand it to someone else or publish for examination. But I 
can now easily do a replay of mount failure and fsck processing as many 
times as needed. For now, it seems file/dir bodies had not been damaged, 
just some system areas had. I've not encountered any file which would 
give wrong checksum or otherwise appeared definitely damaged, with 
overall like 95% verified and definitely fine, 5% hard to reliably 
verify but those are less important files.

No. Generally, it could be just anything, therefore I see no point even 
starting without good background knowledge. That is why I'm trying to 
draw attention of those who are more aware instead. :-)

I have not found any indication of hardware errors at this point.

#grep -i err messages-20241212 | grep sda
(nothing)
#grep -i err messages-20241212 | grep nvme
(nothing)

Some "smart" values are posted above. Nothing suspicious whatsoever.


Thank you!
