Under the assumption that the hardware does not exist, surely there's no 
value in a distro shipping the driver. No argument from me on that point. 
But the assumption is questionable and impossible to validate.

As b04e75a4a8a8 was never reverted, I infer that users of v6.0 (and later) 
do not need the driver. How do you infer that users of distro kernels are 
not using a given driver?
