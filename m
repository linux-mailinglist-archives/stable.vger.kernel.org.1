Really?  Right now we HAVE to pick up the Fixes: tagged commits in those
subsystems as you are missing lots of real fixes.  I just quick looked
and noticed 8cf0a1bc1287 ("capabilities: fix potential memleak on error
path from vfs_getxattr_alloc()") which you should have tagged, right?

In fact, I've considered most of the LSM code as a "we never tag
anything for stable so we rely on the Fixes: pickup to clean up after
us" subsystem.  We have many of those in the kernel, so you are in good
company :)

If a commit has fixes: why wouldn't it be ok for stable trees?  That
feels very odd to me.

Anyway, if you really want, yes, we can add you to the "list of
subsystems we do not pick anything for except by explicit cc: stable
marking" that we have, but note, that feels wrong to me based on the
very low number of patches being tagged for these directories over time.

We have a list, so if you really want it, we can add you to it.  But can
you point out any Fixes: commits that we backported that we shouldn't
have?  If so, why was a Fixes: tag on it?

thanks,
