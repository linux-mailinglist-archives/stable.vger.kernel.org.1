I'm sorry but there's one additional thing that I really should have
mentioned earlier: My issue is specifically with *call* audio.

Call audio is only available using out-of-tree patches. The ones I'm
currently using are here:
https://gitlab.com/sdm845-mainline/linux/-/commits/sdm845-6.13-rc2-r2?ref_t=
ype=3Dtags

Best regards,
  Frank
