5.10-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com>

commit 76be4f5a784533c71afbbb1b8f2963ef9e2ee258 upstream.

Commit 3f1b0e1f2875 (".gitignore update") added *.orig and *.rej
patterns to .gitignore in v2.6.23. The commit message didn't give a
rationale. Later on, commit 1f5d3a6b6532 ("Remove *.rej pattern from
.gitignore") removed the *.rej pattern in v2.6.26, on the rationale that
*.rej files indicated something went really wrong and should not be
ignored.

The *.rej files are now shown by `git status`, which helps located
conflicts when applying patches and lowers the probability that they
will go unnoticed. It is however still easy to overlook the *.orig files
which slowly polute the source tree. That's not as big of a deal as not
noticing a conflict, but it's still not nice.

Drop the *.orig pattern from .gitignore to avoid this and help keep the
source tree clean.

[masahiroy@kernel.org:
I do not have a strong opinion about this. Perhaps some people may have
a different opinion.

If you are someone who wants to ignore *.orig, it is likely you would
want to do so across all projects. Then, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore
would be more suitable for your needs. gitignore(5) suggests, "Patterns
which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations generally go into a
file specified by core.excludesFile in the user's ~/.gitconfig".

Please note that you cannot do the opposite; if *.orig is ignored by
the project's .gitignore, you cannot override the decision because
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore has a lower priority.

If *.orig is sitting on the fence, I'd leave it to the users. ]
