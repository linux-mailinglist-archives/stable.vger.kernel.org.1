5.10-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Steven Rostedt (Google) <rostedt@goodmis.org>

commit 623b1f896fa8a669a277ee5a258307a16c7377a3 upstream.

The tracefs file "buffer_percent" is to allow user space to set a
water-mark on how much of the tracing ring buffer needs to be filled in
order to wake up a blocked reader.

 0 - is to wait until any data is in the buffer
 1 - is to wait for 1% of the sub buffers to be filled
 50 - would be half of the sub buffers are filled with data
 100 - is not to wake the waiter until the ring buffer is completely full

Unfortunately the test for being full was:

	dirty = ring_buffer_nr_dirty_pages(buffer, cpu);
	return (dirty * 100) > (full * nr_pages);

Where "full" is the value for "buffer_percent".

There is two issues with the above when full == 100.

1. dirty * 100 > 100 * nr_pages will never be true
   That is, the above is basically saying that if the user sets
   buffer_percent to 100, more pages need to be dirty than exist in the
   ring buffer!

2. The page that the writer is on is never considered dirty, as dirty
   pages are only those that are full. When the writer goes to a new
   sub-buffer, it clears the contents of that sub-buffer.

That is, even if the check was ">=" it would still not be equal as the
most pages that can be considered "dirty" is nr_pages - 1.

To fix this, add one to dirty and use ">=" in the compare.
