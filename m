Subject: mm: fix oops when filemap_map_pmd() without prealloc_pte
Date: Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:49:18 -0800 (PST)

syzbot reports oops in lockdep's __lock_acquire(), called from
__pte_offset_map_lock() called from filemap_map_pages(); or when I run the
repro, the oops comes in pmd_install(), called from filemap_map_pmd()
called from filemap_map_pages(), just before the __pte_offset_map_lock().

The problem is that filemap_map_pmd() has been assuming that when it finds
pmd_none(), a page table has already been prepared in prealloc_pte; and
indeed do_fault_around() has been careful to preallocate one there, when
it finds pmd_none(): but what if *pmd became none in between?

My 6.6 mods in mm/khugepaged.c, avoiding mmap_lock for write, have made it
easy for *pmd to be cleared while servicing a page fault; but even before
those, a huge *pmd might be zapped while a fault is serviced.

The difference in symptomatic stack traces comes from the "memory model"
in use: pmd_install() uses pmd_populate() uses page_to_pfn(): in some
models that is strict, and will oops on the NULL prealloc_pte; in other
models, it will construct a bogus value to be populated into *pmd, then
__pte_offset_map_lock() oops when trying to access split ptlock pointer
(or some other symptom in normal case of ptlock embedded not pointer).
