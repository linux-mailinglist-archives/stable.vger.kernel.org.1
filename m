With this patch enabling UCSI on sc8280xp:

	https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250326124944.6338-1-johan+linaro@kernel.org/

most of the periodic orientation notifications for the port with the
charger connected appears to be gone on the X13s (note that the T14s
already has UCSI enabled).

I get one to three notification 90 seconds after boot with the charger
connected (and two notifications when reconnecting it) but that appears
to be it.

Perhaps you can give that one a try with your docks and monitors as
well, Clayton and Bjorn.
