We have a list, see this file:

It's actually a requirement, and I am pretty sure, is documented
somewhere...

As the changelog does not show that, I'd prefer to get an ack from the
developers involved before accepting core vfs changes that are not
obviously a bugfix and no one has run into before in the wild.

Also, just lockdep fixes to add markings aren't always needed to be
backported, UNLESS someone is reporting that this is annoying their
system tests, as sometimes happens.

A full list of the git ids, for each branch, you didn't do that here as
a bunch were missed for newer kernels.

Sometimes, but if they are not explicitly marked to be backported with a
 cc: stable line, there is no guarantee at all that they will be.

That's all a great start, try doing that first and we can go from there.
