Subject: mm/vmscan: accumulate nr_demoted for accurate demotion statistics
Date: Fri, 10 Jan 2025 20:21:32 +0800

In shrink_folio_list(), demote_folio_list() can be called 2 times. 
Currently stat->nr_demoted will only store the last nr_demoted( the later
nr_demoted is always zero, the former nr_demoted will get lost), as a
result number of demoted pages is not accurate.

Accumulate the nr_demoted count across multiple calls to
demote_folio_list(), ensuring accurate reporting of demotion statistics.
