Ah, duh, I see it now. kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change() doesn't serialize
on a VM lock, and kvm_vgic_map_resources() has an early return for
vgic_ready() letting it blow straight past the config_lock.

Then if we can't register the MMIO region for the distributor
everything comes crashing down and a vCPU has made it into the KVM_RUN
loop w/ the VGIC-shaped rug pulled out from under it. There's definitely
another functional bug here where a vCPU's attempts to poke the
distributor wind up reaching userspace as MMIO exits. But we can worry
about that another day.

If memory serves, kvm_vgic_map_resources() used to do all of this behind
the config_lock to cure the race, but that wound up inverting lock
ordering on srcu.

Note to self: Impose strict ordering on GIC initialization v. vCPU
creation if/when we get a new flavor of irqchip.

That's an equally gross bug, but kvm_vgic_create() should still be safe
w.r.t. vCPU creation since both hold the kvm->lock in the right spot.
That is, since kvm_vgic_create() is called under the lock any vCPUs
visible to userspace should exist in the vCPU xarray.

The crappy assumption here is kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change() and its
callees are allowed to destroy VM-scoped structures in error handling.

I think this is about as graceful as we can be. The sorts of screw-ups
that precipitate this error handling may involve stupidity across
several KVM ioctls, meaning it is highly unlikely to be attributable /
recoverable.
