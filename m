This is a note to let you know that I've just added the patch titled

    tty: fix hang on tty device with no_room set

to my tty git tree which can be found at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/tty.git
in the tty-testing branch.

The patch will show up in the next release of the linux-next tree
(usually sometime within the next 24 hours during the week.)

The patch will be merged to the tty-next branch sometime soon,
after it passes testing, and the merge window is open.

If you have any questions about this process, please let me know.

Subject: tty: fix hang on tty device with no_room set
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

It is possible to hang pty devices in this case, the reader was
blocking at epoll on master side, the writer was sleeping at
wait_woken inside n_tty_write on slave side, and the write buffer
on tty_port was full, we found that the reader and writer would
never be woken again and blocked forever.

The problem was caused by a race between reader and kworker:
n_tty_read(reader):  n_tty_receive_buf_common(kworker):
copy_from_read_buf()|
                    |room = N_TTY_BUF_SIZE - (ldata->read_head - tail)
                    |room <= 0
n_tty_kick_worker() |
                    |ldata->no_room = true

After writing to slave device, writer wakes up kworker to flush
data on tty_port to reader, and the kworker finds that reader
has no room to store data so room <= 0 is met. At this moment,
reader consumes all the data on reader buffer and calls
n_tty_kick_worker to check ldata->no_room which is false and
reader quits reading. Then kworker sets ldata->no_room=true
and quits too.

If write buffer is not full, writer will wake kworker to flush data
again after following writes, but if write buffer is full and writer
goes to sleep, kworker will never be woken again and tty device is
blocked.

This problem can be solved with a check for read buffer size inside
n_tty_receive_buf_common, if read buffer is empty and ldata->no_room
is true, a call to n_tty_kick_worker is necessary to keep flushing
data to reader.
