6.1-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Dev Jain <dev.jain@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit d4202e66a4b1fe6968f17f9f09bbc30d08f028a1 ]

Patch series "Fixes for compaction_test", v2.

The compaction_test memory selftest introduces fragmentation in memory
and then tries to allocate as many hugepages as possible. This series
addresses some problems.

On Aarch64, if nr_hugepages == 0, then the test trivially succeeds since
compaction_index becomes 0, which is less than 3, due to no division by
zero exception being raised. We fix that by checking for division by
zero.

Secondly, correctly set the number of hugepages to zero before trying
to set a large number of them.

Now, consider a situation in which, at the start of the test, a non-zero
number of hugepages have been already set (while running the entire
selftests/mm suite, or manually by the admin). The test operates on 80%
of memory to avoid OOM-killer invocation, and because some memory is
already blocked by hugepages, it would increase the chance of OOM-killing.
Also, since mem_free used in check_compaction() is the value before we
set nr_hugepages to zero, the chance that the compaction_index will
be small is very high if the preset nr_hugepages was high, leading to a
bogus test success.

This patch (of 3):

Currently, if at runtime we are not able to allocate a huge page, the test
will trivially pass on Aarch64 due to no exception being raised on
division by zero while computing compaction_index.  Fix that by checking
for nr_hugepages == 0.  Anyways, in general, avoid a division by zero by
exiting the program beforehand.  While at it, fix a typo, and handle the
case where the number of hugepages may overflow an integer.
